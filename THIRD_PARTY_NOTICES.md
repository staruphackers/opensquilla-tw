# Third Party Notices

This file records third-party attribution for assets bundled with OpenSquilla.
It covers:

- The bundled skill descriptors under `src/opensquilla/skills/bundled/`, which
  include OpenClaw-derived MIT descriptors and OpenSquilla-original descriptors.
- The bundled pptx skill references the python-pptx and PptxGenJS libraries;
  OpenSquilla does not vendor those libraries, but the skill instructs the
  agent runtime to invoke them and is documented here for transparency.
- The local SquillaRouter V4 Phase 3 model bundle under
  `src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/v4.2_phase3_inference/`.
- The built-in tokenjuice tool-result projection backend and bundled
  reduction rules under `src/opensquilla/plugins/tokenjuice/`.
- The cron prompt-injection scanner was reviewed against Hermes Agent
  reference material; the MIT notice is reproduced below for conservative
  attribution.

## OpenClaw-derived bundled skill descriptors

- Component: SKILL.md frontmatter and instruction text for these bundled skills:
  - `sub-agent`
- `cron`
  - `github`
  - `nano-pdf`
  - `skill-creator`
  - `summarize`
  - `tmux`
  - `weather`
- Upstream project: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
- License: MIT
- Copyright notice: Copyright (c) 2025 Peter Steinberger

Note: `sub-agent` was renamed from `coding-agent` on 2026-05-23; the
descriptor retains the same OpenClaw upstream lineage and MIT attribution.

The descriptor text instructs the agent runtime how to use built-in skill
surfaces and external tools; OpenSquilla does not redistribute third-party CLIs
through these descriptors. Per the MIT license, the upstream copyright and
permission notice are reproduced below in their entirety and apply to the
OpenClaw-derived bundled descriptor files.

## tokenjuice adapted reduction rules

- Component: built-in tokenjuice tool-result projection backend and bundled
  reduction rules under `src/opensquilla/plugins/tokenjuice/`.
- Upstream project: https://github.com/vincentkoc/tokenjuice
- License: MIT

OpenSquilla includes a Python adaptation of tokenjuice's rule-driven reducer
and bundles reduction rules derived from the upstream project. OpenSquilla does
not depend on the upstream tokenjuice npm package at runtime. Additional
provenance is recorded in
`src/opensquilla/plugins/tokenjuice/PROVENANCE.md`; the MIT license text is
also shipped with that package as `LICENSE.tokenjuice`.

## ClawHub MIT bundled skill descriptors

- Component: SKILL.md frontmatter and instruction text for these bundled skills:
  - `filesystem`
- Upstream registry: https://clawhub.ai
- Upstream package: https://clawhub.ai/gtrusler/clawdbot-filesystem
- License: MIT
- Copyright notice: Copyright (c) 2026 Clawdbot Community

The `filesystem` bundled skill metadata, package manifest, and skill card
identify this upstream artifact as MIT licensed. OpenSquilla excludes
skill-local `LICENSE.md` files from wheels as non-runtime skill resources, so
the required MIT notice for this copied descriptor is reproduced here in the
top-level notices distributed with release artifacts.

## Router Artifact Safety Note

The SquillaRouter bundle contains `.pkl` and `.joblib` artifacts used by the
current V4 Phase 3 runtime. Treat these artifacts as executable-code-equivalent
inputs: load only assets shipped with a trusted OpenSquilla release or assets
whose checksums match `artifact_manifest.json`.
