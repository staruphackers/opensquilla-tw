// Guards the route nav taxonomy that the sidebar rail, the mobile drawer, and
// the command palette all read. Before this, the rail rows and the palette Work
// band were hardcoded path lists that silently drifted from route meta; these
// assertions pin the band membership so a future meta edit can't reintroduce a
// vanished or double-listed destination unnoticed.

// Current IA: the Work band pins Sessions + Overview (the Monitor hub, which
// hosts Channels/Usage/Logs as tabs), the Build band (group Operate) holds
// Agents/Skills/Cron, and Approvals is retired from the nav (/approvals
// redirects to /sessions; the strategy moved to Settings → Safety).
