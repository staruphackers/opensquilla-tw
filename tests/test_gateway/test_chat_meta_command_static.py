"""Static contract for the web ``/meta`` slash-command wiring.

The served web UI is the Vite SPA under ``opensquilla-webui/``; its slash
dispatch lives in ``composables/chat/useChatSlashCommands.ts``. JS/TS is not
unit-tested with a JS runner here, so we lock the SPA source text:

- meta-skills are offered as Tab-completable **argument candidates** in the
  slash menu (not a toast), via the command's ``argumentChoices``;
- selecting ``/meta <skill>`` runs it through ``meta.run`` + a hidden turn.

(The legacy ``static/js/views/chat.js`` is NOT served, so it is not the file
under test.)
