"""Router-accuracy fixtures for ``llm_classify`` meta-skills.

Each module under this package contributes a per-router fixture set:
list of :class:`RouterCase` records mapping a representative user
message to its expected ``output_choices`` label, with language and
note tags for slicing.

The fixtures are consumed by two harnesses:

* ``test_meta_router_accuracy.py`` — **offline** sanity gate. Uses a
  deterministic mock ``LLMChat`` that returns ``case.expected_choice``
  verbatim, verifies the routing pipeline (prompt build → LLM call →
  ``_coerce_to_choice`` normalisation → step output) propagates the
  label correctly. Also asserts every fixture's expected_choice is one
  of the bundled skill's actual ``output_choices`` (typo prevention).

* ``test_meta_router_live.py`` — **live** accuracy measurement. Marked
  ``@pytest.mark.llm_router_acc``, runs the same fixtures against a
  real provider (Claude / GPT / Kimi / DeepSeek) and reports per-model
  accuracy. Maintainer-only, never on the default PR path. (D.2 work,
  not yet implemented.)

Adding a new router skill:

1. Create ``tests/test_skills/router_fixtures/<skill_name>.py`` with a
   module-level ``SKILL_NAME``, ``OUTPUT_CHOICES``, and ``CASES``.
2. Import its ``CASES`` here and append to :data:`ALL_CASES`.
3. The offline harness picks up the new cases automatically via the
   parametrise.
