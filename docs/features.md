# Feature Catalog

OpenSquilla combines a personal-agent runtime with model routing, tools, memory,
channels, scheduling, and reusable skills.

## Product Surfaces

| Surface | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| Web UI | Local control console, setup, chat sessions, approvals, logs, channels, and usage surfaces. |
| CLI chat | Interactive terminal agent work. |
| CLI agent | Single-turn automation, CI-like runs, and benchmark-style invocations. |
| Gateway RPC | Local server surface for Web UI, CLI clients, channels, and external clients. |
| Channels | Telegram, Slack, Feishu/Lark, Discord, DingTalk, WeCom, Matrix, QQ, terminal, and websocket-style integrations. |

## Distinctive Features

### SquillaRouter

Local routing for model tier selection. It is designed to keep easy turns cheap
and reserve expensive models for work that needs them.

Read: [`features/squilla-router.md`](features/squilla-router.md)

### TUI Frontend

Terminal chat uses a streaming plane for token deltas and a structured UI plane
for plugin snapshots such as the Router HUD.

Read: [`tui.md`](tui.md) for user-facing terminal chat usage and
[`features/tui-frontend.md`](features/tui-frontend.md) for backend details.

### Tool Compression

Large tool outputs are projected into compact provider-visible previews while
the runtime can keep richer raw results out-of-band.

Read: [`features/tool-compression.md`](features/tool-compression.md)

### Meta-Skills

Repeatable multi-step workflows can be represented as skills, inspected,
proposed, replayed, and reused. By default, users launch them manually on
supported chat surfaces with `/meta` and `/meta <name>`.

Read: [`features/meta-skills.md`](features/meta-skills.md) and
[`features/meta-skill-user-guide.md`](features/meta-skill-user-guide.md)

### Memory

Durable memory lets OpenSquilla recall useful user preferences, project notes,
and previous task traces without forcing every old transcript into the active
prompt.

Read: [`features/memory.md`](features/memory.md)

### Skills

Skills package task-specific guidance and scripts so the agent can load the
right operating instructions only when a task needs them.

Read: [`features/skills.md`](features/skills.md)

### Compaction and Cache Continuity

Long sessions can compact old context, preserve recent task state, and report
compaction lifecycle events.

Read: [`features/compaction-and-cache.md`](features/compaction-and-cache.md)

### Sessions and Durable Agents

Sessions preserve conversation continuity, exports, and running-task control.
Durable agents provide named identities and defaults for recurring workstreams.

Read: [`sessions.md`](sessions.md) and [`agents.md`](agents.md)

### Usage, Diagnostics, and Permissions

Usage reports explain recent model spend. Diagnostics and replay help inspect a
turn after it runs. Permission and approval controls keep tool access matched to
the task.

Read: [`usage-and-cost.md`](usage-and-cost.md),
[`diagnostics-and-replay.md`](diagnostics-and-replay.md), and
[`approvals-and-permissions.md`](approvals-and-permissions.md)

## Skills

Bundled user-facing skills include:

- `deep-research`
- `summarize`
- `memory`
- `cron`
- `github`
- `docx`
- `pptx`
- `xlsx`
- `pdf-toolkit`

built-in product capabilities.

Read: [`features/skills.md`](features/skills.md)

## Scheduling

The `cron` command group manages scheduled OpenSquilla runs:

```sh
opensquilla cron list
opensquilla cron add \
  --every 1h \
  --text "Summarize important project updates" \
  --name hourly-project-check
opensquilla cron status <job-id>
opensquilla cron run <job-id>
opensquilla cron runs <job-id>
```

Scheduled jobs can deliver work through configured surfaces such as channels or
webhooks depending on the configured job.

## Migration

OpenSquilla can import compatible state from OpenClaw and Hermes Agent:

```sh
opensquilla migrate openclaw --json
opensquilla migrate openclaw --apply
opensquilla migrate hermes --json
opensquilla migrate hermes --apply
```
