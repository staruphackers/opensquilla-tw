# Diagnostics and Replay

Diagnostics and replay help explain what happened during an OpenSquilla turn.
Use them when a result was surprising, slow, expensive, interrupted, or hard to
reproduce from the chat transcript alone.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are runtime logging controls exposed through the gateway.

Check status:

```sh
opensquilla diagnostics status
opensquilla diagnostics status --json
```

Enable diagnostics:

```sh
opensquilla diagnostics on
```

Enable raw turn-call capture when a maintainer asks for deeper provider request
evidence:

```sh
opensquilla diagnostics on --raw
```

Turn diagnostics off after collecting enough evidence:

```sh
opensquilla diagnostics off
```

## When to Use Diagnostics

Use diagnostics for:

- provider retries, timeouts, or empty responses;
- SquillaRouter model decisions;
- prompt-cache or cache-break investigation;
- compaction lifecycle events;
- large tool-result compression;
- channel delivery failures;
- unusually high cost or latency.

Avoid leaving raw diagnostics on longer than needed. Raw captures may contain
private prompts, tool outputs, local paths, or provider-visible content.

## Replay a Recorded Turn

Replay reads a recorded turn from the decision log and prints a human-readable
transcript. It is read-only: it does not re-run tools.

```sh
opensquilla replay --session <session-key> --turn <turn-id>
```

Use replay when:

- a chat has moved on but you need to inspect an earlier turn;
- a bug report needs concise reproduction evidence;
- you want to compare transcript output with diagnostics and cost data.

## TUI Replay Benchmarks

Developers can replay deterministic terminal-chat fixtures without a live
provider:

```sh
uv run python scripts/bench_tui_replay.py --renderer opentui --fixture long-stream --summary-json .artifacts/tui/opentui-long-stream.json
uv run python scripts/bench_tui_replay.py --renderer opentui --fixture dense-history --summary-json .artifacts/tui/opentui-dense-history.json
```

Benchmark summaries include renderer availability, event counts, text size,
tool and router-decision counts, wall time, flush counts, maximum buffered text,
coalescing ratio, transcript item counts, visible viewport counts, expanded tool
counts, viewport projection time, final text match status, plugin error count,
and errors.

Read [`features/tui-frontend.md`](features/tui-frontend.md) for backend status
and [`tui-real-terminal-harness.md`](tui-real-terminal-harness.md) for
terminal-level launch evidence.

## Pair Replay With Sessions

Find the session first:

```sh
opensquilla sessions list
opensquilla sessions show <session-key>
```

Export the full session if exact context matters:

```sh
opensquilla sessions export <session-key> --output session.md
```

## Safe Sharing

Before sharing diagnostics, replay output, or exported sessions publicly,
remove:

- provider keys and bearer tokens;
- private local paths;
- private channel identifiers;
- customer, project, or account names that should not be public;
- raw provider prompts or tool outputs that include confidential content.
