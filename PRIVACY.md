# OpenSquilla Privacy Policy

OpenSquilla is a local-first desktop and CLI application. This policy describes
what project-distributed OpenSquilla software stores locally, what it may send
over the network, and how users can opt out or delete local data.

This policy covers OpenSquilla release artifacts published by the OpenSquilla
project. Third-party AI providers, search providers, operating systems, app
stores, package registries, and GitHub are governed by their own policies.

## Local Data

OpenSquilla stores user configuration, sessions, logs, memory, scheduler state,
cache, and provider settings on the user's machine. The default CLI/gateway
state lives under `~/.opensquilla`. The Electron desktop app also uses the
platform Electron `userData` directory for desktop-specific configuration,
encrypted credentials when Electron `safeStorage` is available, and gateway
logs.

OpenSquilla does not require an OpenSquilla account. Provider API keys are
configured by the user and are kept locally as environment variables, local
configuration references, `.env` files, or desktop encrypted storage depending
on the installation path and setup choices.

## Provider Requests

OpenSquilla sends prompts, messages, tool results, selected files, or generated
context to third-party AI providers only when the user configures a provider and
starts a workflow that uses that provider. The exact data sent depends on the
active provider, model, command, channel, skill, and user-selected context.

Users should review their configured provider's terms and privacy policy before
using external models. OpenSquilla cannot control how an external provider
stores, logs, filters, trains on, or processes requests after the provider API
receives them.

## Search, Channels, And Integrations

Features such as web search, channel connectors, GitHub workflows, browser
automation, or other integrations may contact external services when the user
configures and invokes them. OpenSquilla does not send those requests unless the
corresponding feature is enabled by configuration or user action.

## Network Observability Controls

OpenSquilla groups non-user-initiated network observability under one switch.
Set this before startup to disable automatic install telemetry, passive update
checks, and desktop startup auto-update checks:

```sh
OPENSQUILLA_PRIVACY_DISABLE_NETWORK_OBSERVABILITY=true
```

The same control can be set in configuration:

```toml
[privacy]
disable_network_observability = true
```

Legacy environment variables remain honored for compatibility:

```sh
OPENSQUILLA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
OPENSQUILLA_UPDATE_CHECK_DISABLED=true
```

Manual user-initiated actions may still contact network services after user
intent, including manual release, download, or update checks and configured
providers, search, channels, automation, or integrations.

## Installation Telemetry

OpenSquilla uses anonymous installation telemetry to estimate install counts,
version adoption, and runtime compatibility. Telemetry is sent on first gateway
startup and once per OpenSquilla version. Uploads use a short timeout and never
block startup.

Telemetry payloads include:

- schema version
- locally generated stable `install_id` digest
- OpenSquilla version
- event type, such as `install` or `version_seen`
- install method, such as `pip`, `source`, `docker`, `desktop`, or `unknown`
- operating system, OS version, CPU architecture, and Python major/minor version
- first-seen and sent timestamps
- CI/test-environment marker

The `install_id` is a local one-way SHA-256 digest derived from usable MAC
addresses, then local IP addresses when no MAC is available, with a random
persisted fallback. Raw MAC addresses and raw IP addresses are not uploaded.

Telemetry does not include usernames, hostnames, local paths, API keys,
provider configuration, chat content, session content, memory content, agent
content, file names, or file contents. Source IP addresses may be visible to
HTTP servers at the transport layer, but are not part of the telemetry payload.

Use the unified network observability switch above to opt out before startup.
The legacy telemetry opt-out `OPENSQUILLA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` remains
honored for compatibility.

Advanced deployments can direct installation telemetry to their own endpoint:

```sh
OPENSQUILLA_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=https://example.com/v1/install
```

## Logs And Diagnostics

OpenSquilla writes local logs for gateway, desktop, workflow, and troubleshooting
purposes. Logs may include command names, runtime errors, provider identifiers,
timestamps, local status, and diagnostic context. Users should review logs
before sharing them publicly because logs may reflect local configuration or
workflow details.

## Updates And Downloads

OpenSquilla release downloads are hosted on GitHub Releases. Downloading release
assets may expose standard request metadata, such as IP address and user agent,
to GitHub and network intermediaries. Release checksums are published in
`SHA256SUMS` when release assets are generated.

The unified network observability switch disables passive update checks and
desktop startup auto-update checks. Manual release, download, or update checks
may still contact GitHub after the user asks OpenSquilla to perform them.

## Deletion

Use `opensquilla uninstall` to remove OpenSquilla. By default it removes the
program and keeps user data. To delete local state and configuration, opt in:

```sh
opensquilla uninstall --purge-state
opensquilla uninstall --purge-config
opensquilla uninstall --purge-all
```

The command previews and limits deletion to OpenSquilla-owned paths. Desktop
and Docker installs may require platform-specific removal steps shown by the
uninstall command; desktop data cleanup does not remove the OS app bundle.

## Security And Privacy Reports

Report security or privacy issues through the process documented in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Please do not include secrets, API keys, private
conversation content, or unrelated personal data in public issues.
