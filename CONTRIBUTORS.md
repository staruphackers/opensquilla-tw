# OpenSquilla Contributors

OpenSquilla uses GitHub pull requests, commits, release notes, and this
human-readable ledger together for contributor attribution. This file records
release-surface community work that can be harder to see when a release is
squash-merged or replayed onto `main`.

## Attribution Repairs

### PR #46 release-candidate sync

The release-candidate sync in [#46](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/46)
collapsed community-authored work from `dev` into
[2158f56](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/commit/2158f56c1a0684168a013b4b4846233977d0067b)
without co-author trailers for the human commit authors below. This ledger entry
repairs the project-facing attribution record without rewriting protected branch
history. Later suspected cases were rechecked separately; their human authors
are represented on `main` by equivalent authored commits and/or co-author
trailers.

## OpenSquilla 0.4.1

The 0.4.1 release records new human contributor work after the 0.4.0
attribution ledger was merged. It intentionally does not repeat the larger
0.4.0 contributor list.

| Contributor | 0.4.1 contribution | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@ab2ence](https://github.com/ab2ence) | Hardened install telemetry so CI and test environments are not counted as installs, and allowed desktop HTML artifacts to open natively. | [#348](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/348), [#355](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/355) |

## OpenSquilla 0.4.0

The 0.4.0 release is prepared from current `dev` after `v0.3.1`. This section
records non-Open-Squilla contributor work with pull-request evidence in that
range. Some work was replayed or carried through Open-Squilla integration pull
requests; those rows name the original contributor and cite both the original
pull request and the integration pull request when useful.

## OpenSquilla 0.3.1

The 0.3.1 release is prepared as a release-surface replay from `dev` onto the
stable `main` release ledger. Some community work in the release window was
already represented by earlier `main` attribution work; this section records
the 0.3.1-specific community contributions acknowledged in the release notes.

| Contributor | 0.3.1 contribution | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@openvictory](https://github.com/openvictory) | Visible running-state feedback plus short-drama and media helper workflows. | [#123](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/123), [#133](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/133), [#137](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/137) |

## OpenSquilla 0.3.0

The 0.3.0 release reached `main` through release synchronization after work had
landed through `dev` and integration branches. That compressed the default
branch commit history, so the following community contributions are recorded
explicitly here.

| Contributor | 0.3.0 contribution | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@ab2ence](https://github.com/ab2ence) | Tokenjuice tool-result compression and canonical projection, memory dream consolidation, chat streaming restore work, and cross-platform CI hardening. | [#56](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/56), [#61](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/61), [#81](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/81), [#88](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/88), [#109](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/pull/109) |

## Attribution Practice

When maintainer cleanup, replay, or squash merging collapses contributor
commits, the final non-empty commit should preserve each human contributor with
`Co-authored-by:` trailers that use GitHub-associated email addresses. Preserve
pull request author attribution and commit author attribution separately when
they differ.
