/**
 * Coordinates Desktop-owned profile writers with lifecycle operations.
 *
 * A normal writer calls `begin` and always invokes the returned idempotent
 * finish callback. Update, quit, or another lifecycle boundary calls `close`
 * before waiting for active writers to drain. An operation that must close
 * admission and reserve its own writer slot atomically uses
 * `tryBeginExclusive`.
 *
 * This class deliberately has no cleanup or deletion policy. It only owns
 * admission and drain state, so recovery, update, and quit can share the same
 * contract without inheriting destructive-operation semantics.
