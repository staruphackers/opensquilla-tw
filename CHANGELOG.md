## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.2.0rc1] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `opensquilla migrate` imports existing OpenClaw/Hermes homes into OpenSquilla
  with dry-run previews, explicit `--apply`, source auto-detection, migration
  reports, memory/persona conflict handling, skill compatibility reporting, and
  MCP/channel config mapping.
- `opensquilla chat` is now an early usable interactive CLI chat surface with a
  persistent terminal UI, streaming output, queued input, slash-mode discovery,
  prompt/status chrome, tool-call feedback, inline approval handling, and
  deterministic live prompt output.
- Cron automation now spans CLI, WebUI, RPC, channel, and webhook surfaces:
  structured schedule creation, timezone-aware cron/every/at schedules,
  exact/jitter controls, manual runs, channel delivery, webhook delivery, and
  failure destinations.
- Feishu and Discord channel support now includes capability manifests, safer
  DM/group policy metadata, native file/artifact paths, attachment ingestion,
  Feishu websocket/webhook handling, Discord thread/group handling, and clearer
  channel health/status reporting.
- OpenSquilla can run as an inbound MCP server bridge for session workflows:
  clients can list sessions, resolve/read conversation history, send messages,
  and wait for session events through the gateway.
- Generated artifact delivery is more complete across WebUI and channels,
  including traceable generated-file delivery, recovered fallback delivery,
  channel-safe artifact text, and Unicode-safe PDF report rendering.
- Memory surfaces now separate curated memory from raw transcript search, recall
  prior-session evidence, keep manual Dream runs on configured memory
  workspaces, and let compaction continue when memory flush degrades.
- Release/install support now includes tag-pinned preview URLs, reproducible
  wheel/portable release guidance, source install scripts, Windows portable
  hardening, ONNX/router recovery messaging, and Docker/compose alignment on
  the gateway port.

### Changed

- Release installation docs now use version-pinned `0.2.0rc1` asset URLs for
  preview installs and reserve `/releases/latest/download/` aliases for stable
  releases.
- Cron tool calls now require structured schedule input (`{kind, ...}`) instead
  of backend natural-language schedule parsing. CLI cron flags still accept
  standard user-facing forms such as `--cron`, `--every`, `--at`, and
  `--expression` through RPC compatibility paths.
- Tool dispatch now runs through a policy pipeline with side-effect-aware
  concurrency: safe/read-only tools can batch, while mutating or
  side-effecting tools stay serialized, keyed, or capped.
- Long-running agent turns now use staged `TurnRunner` execution, provider
  request-budget compaction, prompt-cache anchor preservation, bounded
  tool-result storage, approval-aware retry handling, and recovery paths for
  malformed or non-executable tool calls.
- Channel adapters now declare normalized capability and error-taxonomy
  metadata so unsupported, degraded, retryable, and fatal channel behavior is
  surfaced more consistently.
- WebUI chat, sessions, usage, setup, cron, and search surfaces now share more
  runtime-backed state for recency ordering, per-turn token metrics, provider
  badges, setup form behavior, and session cancellation/readback.
- The default gateway/release documentation now centers on port `18791`, and
  preview release URLs are tag-pinned until a stable release can use latest
  aliases.

### Fixed

- Failed or aborted turns are kept out of later provider context, reducing
  cascading failures after a bad turn.
- Approval-gated tool retries wait for operator decisions instead of exposing
  pending approval state as ordinary model-visible tool output.
- Provider-context tool markers are protected from becoming executable tool
  state.
- High-volume tool and chat turns recover more reliably from request-tail bloat,
  current-turn tool overflow, and provider payload budget pressure.
- Channel replies avoid leaking provider compaction markers, and channel cron
  delivery now reports failures explicitly.
- WebUI reliability fixes cover recency ordering, table boundaries, mobile and
  composer layout, duplicate visible toasts, setup form resilience, search
  provider badges, and session cancellation counters.
- Generated files that were omitted from normal delivery can be recovered
  through the artifact fallback path.
- Feishu-delivered PDF reports now render Unicode text instead of black or
  placeholder glyph blocks.

## [0.1.0rc1] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- OOTB startup path: `compose.yaml` + `start.sh` + `start.ps1` + Quickstart section in README.
- Legacy `memory.*` config fields: 16 deprecated keys silently dropped with a single aggregated `DeprecationWarning`.
- Agent CLI no-key error: three-section actionable panel (Symptom / Cause / Next steps).
- Tool concurrency: same-turn safe `tool_calls` dispatched concurrently via `asyncio.gather` (22 safe tools enrolled in `_SAFE_TOOL_NAMES`; mutex tools remain serial).
- PID file lock to prevent two gateway instances from sharing the same state directory.
- Core observability counters: `opensquilla_queue_depth`, `in_flight_turns_total`, `turn_cancellations_total`, `queue_full_errors_total`.
- CI matrix on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` × Python 3.11/3.12, including a metric-name drift check and a tracemalloc leak smoke step.
- Per-channel-adapter in-flight reply cap (`_ChannelInFlightSet`) so a single channel cannot exhaust the global concurrency budget.
- Cross-session fair queueing: sessions sharing an `agent_id` round-robin available slots by completion count.
- Session epoch counter so events from a pre-reset turn are discarded by the frontend after `session.reset`.
- Atomic write helper for transcript attachments (`_atomic_write_bytes`): tmp + fsync + `os.replace`.
- Concurrency env overrides — `OPENSQUILLA_TASK_MAX_CONCURRENCY` and `OPENSQUILLA_CHANNEL_INFLIGHT_CAP` — with invalid-value fallback and warning logs.

### Changed

- Internal SquillaRouter package moved from `opensquilla.contrib.squilla_router`
  to `opensquilla.squilla_router`; bundled model assets now live under
  `src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/`.
- `TurnRunner` and `TaskRuntime` share a single per-session `asyncio.Lock` (injected via `session_lock_provider`), removing the two-layer lock dictionary and the reverse-acquire risk it created.

### Fixed

- Channel adapter ghost-turn bug: a `TaskQueueFullError` no longer leaves a dangling user message in the transcript.
- `TaskRuntime` terminal-state dictionary leak across `_tasks`, `_session_locks`, and `_pending_by_session`.
