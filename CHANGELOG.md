# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Legacy home migration: `opensquilla migrate opensquilla` imports an
  existing OpenSquilla home — a CLI `~/.opensquilla`, a retired Windows
  portable data directory (enumerated with a chooser across
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenSquilla\portable\*`), or an explicit `--source` path
  (Docker volumes, relocated or restored homes) — into the current install.
  Dry-run by default with a pinned machine-readable report
  (`docs/self-migration-report-contract.md`); apply stages a whole-home
  copy with WAL-safe database handling and commits transactionally, so an
  interrupted import never leaves a partial target. Imported configs drop
  stale absolute path pins, inline provider keys relocate to `.env`, and
  imported scheduler jobs arrive paused. Entry points: the desktop
  onboarding offers detected legacy data as a first step (with provider
  prefill), Settings → Runtime gains an "Import legacy data" rescue action,
  the Web UI setup flow shows a read-only legacy-data advisory
  (`onboarding.status` gains the additive `legacyData` block), gateway boot
  warns once when a fresh home coexists with legacy data, and doctor emits
  a `migration.legacy_home_detected` finding with copyable fix commands.
- Golden legacy-config fixtures: every released line's default config dump
  (0.1 through 0.5, portable and desktop shapes) is pinned as a fixture and
  must load on current code, so old-config upgrades are tested mechanically.
- The Web UI gains an opt-in background-music player. Enabling it (Settings →
  Appearance, or the command palette action) reveals a topbar control that
  loops tracks from a user-supplied library: `public/music/playlist.local.json`
  lists bundled filenames or HTTPS URLs, and a session-only "Choose local
  file…" picker plays ad-hoc audio. Track choice, volume, and play state
  persist per browser; the feature is off by default and no audio files ship
  with the repository (see `opensquilla-webui/public/music/README.md`).
- Attachment resource ceilings: the in-memory staged-upload store now has an
  aggregate RAM cap (`attachments.upload_store_max_total_bytes`, default
  300 MiB) — when reached, new uploads are rejected with the additive HTTP
  507 `UPLOAD_STORE_FULL` (retryable; staged entries expire within the TTL)
  instead of evicting staged uploads — and attachment copies materialized
  into agent workspaces are bounded by a disk budget
  (`attachments.workspace_attachment_disk_budget_bytes`, default 1 GiB) that
  degrades new materializations to an unavailable marker without evicting
  existing files.
- Provider connection tests now report latency: `onboarding.provider.probe`
  returns an additive `latencyMs` field (0 on pre-network failures), the CLI
  `models probe --json` rows carry `latency_ms`, and the Web UI setup panel
  renders a verdict line — connected state with round-trip latency, live
  model count, and sample model ids; failure pills include the latency so a
  fast 401 rejection reads differently from a slow timeout.
- `[models.<provider_id>."<model_id>"].context_window` now governs context
  budgeting as documented: the catalog resolver consults the per-model
  override first (new `override` source), the turn budget ladder, compaction
  window, usage pressure (`windowSource: "model_override"`), and router
  capability facts all honor it, and the per-model value beats the global
  `llm.context_window_tokens`. The Web UI setup panel gains a context-window
  override field with an auto-detected/override/effective readout and a
  small-window warning for local runtimes.
- Doctor now lints API-key shape: a key that looks like a URL or an
  environment-variable name yields a `provider.active.api_key_shape` warning
  (shape only — key material never leaves the gateway) with recovery steps.
  `providers.status` rows carry the additive `apiKeyShape` field.
- The console Overview can copy the full doctor report as sanitized JSON
  (home paths normalized) and hand it to a new agent chat ("Diagnose with
  agent", hidden when the provider itself blocks readiness); findings for
  provider/channel/router surfaces deep-link into the matching settings
  section, and `/settings/provider#provider-<id>` preselects that provider.
- Passive provider latency stats: the agent loop records time-to-first-token
  and call duration per provider call into an in-memory rolling window;
  `providers.status` rows expose an additive `latency` snapshot
  (`p50TtftMs`/`p95TtftMs`/`samples`, gated below minimum sample counts) and
  the Overview shows a latency readout for the active provider.
- The chat view warns when a streaming turn produces no content events for
  90 seconds (server heartbeats alone no longer look like progress): a
  dismissible notice offers keep-waiting or interrupt, and stays quiet while
  a tool is executing or an approval is pending.

- Added Tencent TokenHub providers for the Hunyuan hy3 family:
  `tencent_tokenhub` (OpenAI-compatible mainland endpoint,
  `TENCENT_TOKENHUB_API_KEY`), `tencent_tokenhub_anthropic` (the same
  deployment's Anthropic Messages protocol with `x-api-key` auth), and
  `tencent_tokenhub_intl` (the international deployment with its own
  `TENCENT_TOKENHUB_INTL_API_KEY`). hy3/hy3-preview thinking maps onto the
  documented `reasoning_effort` `low`/`high` values plus the thinking enable
  object, and assistant `reasoning_content` is replayed across turns per the
  hy3 interleaved-thinking contract. The Token Plan subscription is covered
  too: `tencent_token_plan` (Chat Completions at
  `api.lkeap.cloud.tencent.com/plan/v3`) and `tencent_token_plan_anthropic`
  (Anthropic Messages at `/plan/anthropic`, bearer auth), both reading the
  dedicated `TENCENT_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` (`sk-tp-…`) plan credential.
- Attachments now accept **any file type** on every surface (Web UI, desktop,
  CLI `/file`, channels, RPC). Rendered families (images, PDF, text, Office,
  email) keep their extraction and anti-forgery behavior; everything else is
  admitted as an *opaque* attachment staged into the agent workspace — the
  bytes are never parsed, decompressed, or inlined into a provider prompt, and
  the model receives an escaped metadata envelope plus the workspace path.
  New config: `attachments.accept_opaque` (default `true`; `false` restores
  the legacy fail-closed admission gate) and `attachments.opaque_max_bytes`
  (default 30 MiB).
- Text attachments above the 2 MB inline threshold now stage through the
  upload endpoint up to 30 MiB when the whole payload is proven UTF-8, so
  large LaTeX sources and logs no longer dead-end at "file too large".
- Channel file downloads (Telegram, Discord, Feishu, Matrix) now use staged
  per-category ceilings, so archives, voice notes, and videos up to 30 MiB
  ingest instead of being silently skipped at a flat 5 MiB unknown-type cap.

- Added Alibaba Cloud IQS (`iqs`) as a runtime-supported web search provider:
  unified-search endpoint with freshness, site include/exclude filters, inline
  main-text content, and rerank scores, configured via `IQS_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
- Added a runtime development branch sync: request-proof budgeting with
  deterministic compaction, DashScope provider profile with prompt-cache
  markers and thinking-mode plumbing, an optional LLM trace recorder,
  tool-result store compression, sandbox-descriptor integration for
  filesystem tools, and a family of default-off, env-lever-controlled
  runtime recovery modules.
- Prebuilt multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) container images are
  published to GHCR (`ghcr.io/opensquilla/opensquilla`) on release tags,
  with a manual dispatch mode that validates the build without publishing.
- `docs/docker.md`: a container deployment guide for home servers and NAS
  (Debian 12 walkthrough, prebuilt images, LAN exposure with token auth,
  bind-mount ownership, upgrades and rollback).

### Changed

- An explicitly configured `llm.base_url` now wins over the provider's
  derived environment variable (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, …),
  mirroring the existing api_key rule. Previously the env var silently
  overrode a custom endpoint saved in the Web UI or via `config.set` on
  every boot/reload, reverting it to the env value (#484). Endpoints that
  were never explicitly chosen — a config without `base_url`, or one holding
  the provider's default URL — still follow the env var, so fleet-wide
  `*_BASE_URL` overrides keep working, and `OPENSQUILLA_LLM_BASE_URL`
  (the settings layer) still fills an unset `base_url` and then counts as
  explicit. As a side effect, a minimal config such as
  `provider = "openai"` without `base_url` now resolves to that provider's
  own default endpoint instead of leaking the OpenRouter URL from the model
  field default.
- **Security:** the gateway no longer emits CORS headers by default —
  `cors.allowed_origins` now defaults to `[]` instead of `"*"`. The Web UI
  (served same-origin from the gateway), the CLI, curl, and the desktop app
  are unaffected. Deployments that serve a separate frontend from another
  origin must list that origin explicitly in `cors.allowed_origins` to
  restore the previous behavior; configuring `"*"` together with
  `cors.allow_credentials` now logs a boot-time warning.
- **Security:** state-changing gateway HTTP routes (chat send, system
  shutdown, approvals settings/resolve, elevated mode, channel logout, file
  upload, audio transcription, artifact native open, diagnostics bundle) now
  reject browser requests whose `Origin` is not the gateway itself with
  `403 FORBIDDEN_ORIGIN`, extending the diagnostics-bundle same-origin guard
  to the whole HTTP surface. Requests without an `Origin` header (curl, the
  desktop client) and origins listed in `cors.allowed_origins` still pass.
- `compose.yaml` now documents prebuilt-image selection, safe LAN exposure,
  and Web UI token auth, and the troubleshooting guide covers common Docker
  deployment failures.
- The Web UI composer's file picker no longer sets an `accept=` filter, so
  native file dialogs (notably on Windows) show all files instead of hiding
  types like `.tex` (#472). The attach-button tooltip in all six locales now
  describes the any-type policy.
- Under the default `attachments.accept_opaque = true`, the upload endpoint
  no longer returns HTTP 415 `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` for type reasons and
  `sessions.send` no longer raises `unsupported_mime` for unrendered types;
  the codes and message formats are unchanged for strict deployments that
  disable the flag. Clients that string-matched the "must be one of [...]"
  detail should rely on the typed codes instead.
- Transcripts written by this version may contain opaque attachment
  envelopes; older builds replay such history with the attachment silently
  omitted (current builds emit an omission marker).
- Common non-canonical MIME spellings (`image/jpg`,
  `application/x-zip-compressed`, `application/x-gzip`) now normalize to
  their canonical types in every mode, so an `image/jpg` upload is accepted
  as JPEG even under `accept_opaque = false` where it previously drew a 415.

- Provider retry handling: responses that stop at the length limit without
  visible text or tool calls now enter the reasoning-only retry path instead
  of the length-capped continuation path, and a thinking-related provider
  stream error now disables thinking for the next call only (one-shot)
  instead of the rest of the turn.
- Context compaction: `read_file` and `git_diff` results are preserved
  verbatim (exempt from semantic projection and aggregate compaction), tool
  results already shown in full are no longer retroactively compacted under
  context pressure, and compaction placeholders gained `preview_complete`
  plus retrieval hints.
- Tool dispatch: a preflight validation pipeline now rejects malformed tool
  calls before execution and reports invalid tool arguments as retryable;
  `write_file` refuses destructive overwrites that would shrink an existing
  large workspace file by more than half; `grep_search` output gained a
  header, offset paging, VCS-directory exclusion, and binary-file skipping;
  `edit_file` accepts single-edit shorthand and recovers from near-miss
  matches by default; `apply_patch` accepts `@@` hunks with optional counts.
- The `coding` tool profile now enforces fresh workspace reads before edits.
- `match_workspace_write_deny` deny patterns now apply only to
  workspace-contained paths (previously they could match paths outside the
  workspace).
- Request-proof compaction marks compacted tool arguments with inline
  `[provider_request_tool_input_compacted: ...]` markers instead of a JSON
  envelope.

### Fixed

- The desktop gateway now receives the OpenSquilla home root (not the state
  subdirectory) in `OPENSQUILLA_STATE_DIR`; a one-time relocation moves the
  previously nested skills, workspace, session archive, router data, and
  `.env` up to their intended locations without touching the databases.
- Legacy configs no longer hard-fail strict validation: stale
  `memory.dream.model_override` keys are stripped, channel entries with
  unregistered types are parked with a warning instead of rejecting the
  file, a `squilla_router.tier_profile` that no longer matches
  `llm.provider` is cleared, and an unwritable config location degrades the
  post-migration rewrite to a warning instead of failing boot.
- The desktop shell resolves the UI language from the OS preference list
  correctly: English tags now match in place instead of falling through (a
  Hong Kong list like `en-HK, zh-Hans-HK, …, fr-HK` previously landed on
  French), and an explicit `Hans` script subtag wins over a
  Traditional-default region, so `zh-Hans-HK`/`zh-Hans-TW` readers get
  Simplified Chinese instead of the English fallback. The resolver is
  extracted to `desktop/electron/src/desktop-locale.ts` with a regression
  suite (`npm run test:desktop-locale`).
- Dream (memory consolidation) now resolves its provider credentials through
  the shared explicit-config-first resolver: previously `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` /
  `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` in the gateway environment unconditionally overrode
  the configured key and endpoint — even when the configured provider was not
  OpenRouter — silently redirecting Dream turns away from the operator's
  endpoint.
- Fixed managed-network sandbox domain grants missing the Bocha, Tavily, and
  Exa search API hosts: `web_search` runs with those providers active were
  blocked under the managed-network sandbox. All runtime search providers now
  have system domain grants and default search-allowlist entries, enforced by
  a contract test.
- Byte-level text sniffing no longer misclassifies clean UTF-8 payloads as
  binary when a multibyte character straddles the sniff peek window (affected
  CJK plain-text uploads with unrendered MIME claims).

- Fixed secret redaction missing assignment values that start with a quote
  (for example `password: "..."`); quoted values are now masked in memory
  persistence and trace capture paths.

## [0.5.0rc2] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added clearer provider/router setup surfaces, config provenance RPC coverage,
  preset registry behavior, custom provider substrate, and cross-provider router
  settings for the 0.5 preview line.

### Changed

- Kept fresh installs on the direct single-model `squilla_router` path while
  making front-end-enabled ensemble mode default to `static_openrouter_b5`.
- Refined desktop onboarding, session empty states, ensemble progress display,
  and packaged Web UI assets for the Preview 2 release surface.

### Fixed

- Fixed main CI contract drift around default router mode, migration/provider
  persistence, static-B5 doctor checks, and onboarding status wire fields.
- Fixed code-task scaffold prompts so build-mode scaffolding stays
  non-interactive.
- Fixed expired staged Web UI uploads by refreshing file UUIDs before send when
  the original file remains available.
- Fixed local HTML artifact opening, desktop reopen behavior, cancelled-turn
  rollback, sandbox denial resume recovery, composer draft persistence, session
  cleanup, attachment isolation, and several provider/router recovery paths.

## [0.5.0rc1] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added dynamic Model Ensemble routing, OpenAI/Codex-oriented provider support,
  direct single-model routing defaults, and progressive reveal behavior so
  preview users can test the new routing line before the next stable release.
- Added managed execution host-routing paths and sandbox/approval alignment for
  safer terminal, desktop, and host-execution workflows.
- Added Control UI and desktop affordances for router/provider settings,
  drag-and-drop attachments, history materialization, and image preview
  navigation.
- Added OpenTUI preview improvements for terminal and gateway workflows.

### Changed

- Preview release assets now publish Electron desktop installers, updater
  metadata, a versioned Python wheel, and `SHA256SUMS`; new 0.5 preview releases
  no longer publish Windows portable zips or portable latest aliases.
- Sandbox run modes, approval boundaries, and managed host execution now share
  clearer authorization and diagnostics across Windows, Linux, and desktop
  sessions.
- Desktop update, privacy, code-signing, and release documentation now describe
  the preview asset set and portable retirement path.

### Fixed

- Improved Windows subprocess encoding, process cleanup, gateway lifecycle
  diagnostics, router timeout handling, and packaged desktop runtime checks.
- Fixed desktop/Web UI recovery cases around settings restore, refreshed
  sessions, image preview movement, attachment handling, and provider/router
  visibility.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- `opensquilla uninstall` removes OpenSquilla across install methods (uv-tool,
  pip, pipx, and source; portable removes its venv; Docker and desktop print
  guided removal steps). It keeps your data by default — pass `--purge-state`,
  `--purge-config`, or `--purge-all` to delete it (a total wipe requires a typed
  confirmation phrase on every surface), and `--dry-run` / `--json` preview the
  exact remove/keep/manual plan without touching anything. Deletion is contained
  to the OpenSquilla home; a relocated or shared root is refused. The desktop
  Settings → Runtime panel gains a matching "Danger zone".
- The Control UI and desktop client now ship first-class localization for
  English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, French, German, and Spanish, including
  first-paint desktop boot text, settings surfaces, and persisted language
  selection.

### Changed

- Stopping, restarting, or uninstalling the gateway now drains in-flight agent
  turns and background completions before exit instead of cutting them off
  mid-write. The force-kill deadline exceeds the drain budget (tunable via
  `OPENSQUILLA_GATEWAY_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT`); on Windows, an owner-only
  `POST /api/system/shutdown` endpoint provides the same graceful stop where
  POSIX signals are unavailable.
- OpenSquilla now treats `main` as the active development and release
  integration branch, with release guidance and pull-request targeting language
  aligned around `main`.
- Desktop packaging now fails fast when SquillaRouter assets are missing or
  still Git LFS pointer files, and the packaged gateway smoke tests exercise
  coding mode, `code-task`, and the router runtime before release assets are
  uploaded.

### Fixed

- Install telemetry now skips CI and test environments before creating local
  telemetry state or uploading install events, so GitHub Actions and pytest
  runs do not count as user installs.
- The Windows Electron app, installer, and uninstaller now use the OpenSquilla
  icon.
- Web UI fixes keep streaming turns, stale task events, session deletion,
  settings restore, topbar connection state, status line breaks, and desktop
  HTML artifact opening stable across refreshed sessions.
- Provider and router fixes improve Volcengine and BytePlus profiles, macOS
  router runtime diagnostics, and the target labels shown for model requests.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- The refreshed Control UI is now the default browser console, with a
  conversation-first sidebar, Settings modal, Sessions ledger, artifact
  previews, share export, deliverables drawer, turn trace, mobile tabs, and
  clearer Skills, Usage, Cron, Logs, and Approvals surfaces.
- Signed desktop release assets are now available for the Vue/Electron desktop
  shell: a notarized macOS Apple Silicon DMG/ZIP and a Windows x64 NSIS
  installer.
- Coding mode and the `code-task` workflow provide a guarded path for code
  changes: code work runs through an isolated run directory, uses trusted-host
  confirmation, and verifies before persisting changes back to the source.
- `opensquilla swebench` adds an optional SWE-bench evaluation surface for
  users who install `opensquilla[swebench]` and have Docker available.
- OpenTUI preview backend documentation now covers explicit opt-in usage,
  dependency setup, replay benchmarks, and real-terminal harness evidence.
- Web search now supports DuckDuckGo, Bocha, Brave, Tavily, and Exa through the
  runtime provider catalog, with source-backed `web_search` and lightweight
  `web_discover` roles documented for agent workflows.
- `openai_responses` exposes OpenAI's native Responses API shape alongside
  `openai`, sharing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the default OpenAI base URL while
  making Responses-specific behavior selectable by provider id.

### Changed

- MetaSkills are now **manual-only by default**. They no longer auto-trigger from
  message keywords or appear in the runtime prompt; run them explicitly with the
  new `/meta` command (`/meta` lists available MetaSkills, `/meta <name>` runs
  one). To restore the previous automatic behavior, set
  `meta_skill.auto_trigger = true`. Full list+run is available in web chat and
  the CLI gateway TUI; channel and standalone CLI surfaces support `/meta`
  listing only.
- Terminal chat documentation now distinguishes the stable Python-native default
  backend from the opt-in OpenTUI preview backend.
- Search configuration now treats `search_provider` as the credential anchor for
  a configured key rather than a hard routing promise for automatic searches.
- The old Windows portable zip remains published as a legacy compatibility
  build, while new Windows desktop users should prefer the Electron installer.

### Fixed

- Provider stream parsing accepts no-space SSE data lines, and Gemini thought
  signatures are preserved across tool turns so provider continuity metadata can
  be replayed safely.
- The SSRF guard now gives operators actionable fake-IP DNS guidance while
  keeping private, loopback, link-local, and internal ranges blocked by default.
- Runtime, gateway, and Web UI fixes improve session recovery, attachment and
  artifact handling, approval event delivery, share-image export, router
  visibility, and cross-platform test stability.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Slack Socket Mode support now covers app mentions, self-targeting replies,
  channel metadata, and threaded response routing across onboarding and channel
  runtime paths.
- Short-drama and video helper workflows remain available in the bundled
  MetaSkill catalog, with stronger Windows-safe script handling and clearer
  review pauses for generated media flows.
- CI impact-surface gates classify docs, runtime, dependency, release, and test
  changes so pull requests can run the right checks without forcing the full
  matrix for every documentation-only edit.

### Changed

- WebChat and the Skills view now make MetaSkill readiness, active runs, and
  install visibility easier to inspect while workflows are being reviewed.
- Release install documentation and installer defaults now point to the 0.3.1
  wheel and Windows portable asset names.

### Fixed

- User chat bubbles preserve multiline text and read like authored messages
  instead of collapsing or visually blending with generated output.
- Slack onboarding and runtime paths now reject incomplete Socket Mode setup,
  preserve existing secrets, enforce webhook signing secrets where needed, and
  keep threaded reply channel context.
- Voice/audio workflows and clarification pauses are represented on the main
  release line, so release users get the same usable handoff and resume
  behavior already validated on integration branches.
- Provider request hardening keeps malformed tool-call history from reaching
  providers as invalid request state.

### Acknowledgements

  running-state feedback plus short-drama and media helper workflows into the
  0.3.1 release line.
- Thanks @freeaccount-create for #142, which helped bring Slack Socket Mode and
  self-targeting replies into the channel workflow.
- Thanks @ruhook for #124, and thanks @qq712696307 for the authored commit in
  that pull request, which preserved user message newlines in WebChat.
- Thanks @Cola-Alex for #143, which increased tokenjuice summarize and
  failure-context windows for fallback tool-result projection.
- Thanks @nice-code-la for #165 and #166, which helped make voice workflows
  usable end to end and clarification pauses resume cleanly.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- MetaSkills are now first-class workflow capabilities: bundled stable
  MetaSkills, composition parsing, step scheduling, pause/resume user-input
  flows, proposal gates, runtime history, and authoring documentation let
  repeatable multi-step work become reusable agent routines.
- `opensquilla doctor` and the WebUI Health view now provide actionable
  readiness diagnostics across provider, gateway, memory, logs, search, image
  generation, router, channels, sandbox, and embedding surfaces.
- Tokenjuice-backed tool-result projection now compacts large logs, diffs,
  JSON, test output, package-manager output, and other known tool shapes before
  they crowd out provider context.
- A task-oriented documentation set now covers quickstart, configuration,
  WebUI, CLI, tools and sandboxing, sessions, providers, usage and cost,
  memory, compaction, MetaSkills, tool compression, scheduling, channels, MCP,
  troubleshooting, and contribution guidance.

### Changed

- Tool-output context management now separates durable runtime results from
  provider-visible compact previews, records projection telemetry, and uses
  provider request proof/compaction before oversized payloads reach an LLM.
- WebChat, CLI chat, and terminal TUI internals now share more runtime-backed
  turn, stream, slash-command, artifact, attachment, and recovery behavior.
- Long-session memory and compaction flows now preserve raw archive evidence,
  checkpoint receipts, repair queues, and WebUI-safe compaction status instead
  of treating semantic memory quality and context safety as the same signal.
- Channel install extras now expose only real optional packages; Feishu,
  Telegram, DingTalk, WeCom, and QQ are included in the base install instead
  of being accepted as no-op extras.

### Fixed

- WebChat reliability fixes cover router replay, session restore gaps,
  duplicate compaction status, attachment and pasted-text rendering, artifact
  downloads, composer layout, model-router animation timing, and visible
  recovery during long turns.
- Provider and runtime hardening reduces malformed tool-call fallout, preserves
  configured model-switch intent, handles provider tool-choice requirements,
  and keeps oversized current-turn tool payloads from surfacing as bare
  internal failures.
- Cross-platform CI and Windows portability fixes stabilize CLI help rendering,
  sqlite fallback behavior, UTF-8 subprocess handling, Windows-only test
  fixtures, onboarding commands, and release-surface checks.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- WebUI diagnostics, transcript replay, and artifact presentation now retain
  more turn-usage evidence while keeping generated-file markers out of normal
  chat output.
- Long-running agent turns now expose softer recovery paths for exhausted tool
  budgets, repeated tool failures, large file-write attempts, and artifact
  delivery handoffs when the final model response degrades.
- Release metadata, installer defaults, and documented wheel URLs now point to
  the 0.2.1 release line.

### Fixed

- Windows portable startup now includes a stronger Visual C++ runtime bootstrap
  path for the bundled ONNX router.
- Memory semantic recall now normalizes stored and query embeddings before
  sqlite-vec search, and high-confidence lexical matches are preserved even
  when vector scoring is weak.
- Generated artifact placeholder text is removed from WebChat history and
  channel-facing output after files have already been delivered.
- Tool dispatch and result budgeting reduce bare internal budget failures by
  returning model-visible recovery context when a turn can still continue.

### Acknowledgements

- Thanks @nice-code-la for the portable Windows VC++ runtime bootstrap work in
  #52.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `opensquilla migrate` imports existing OpenClaw/Hermes homes into OpenSquilla
  with dry-run previews, explicit `--apply`, source auto-detection, migration
  reports, memory/persona conflict handling, skill compatibility reporting, and
  MCP/channel config mapping.
- `opensquilla chat` is now an early usable interactive CLI chat surface with a
  persistent terminal UI, streaming output, queued input, slash-mode discovery,
  prompt/status chrome, tool-call feedback, inline approval handling, and
  deterministic live prompt output.
- Cron automation now spans CLI, WebUI, RPC, channel, and webhook surfaces:
  structured schedule creation, timezone-aware cron/every/at schedules,
  exact/jitter controls, manual runs, channel delivery, webhook delivery, and
  failure destinations.
- Feishu and Discord channel support now includes capability manifests, safer
  DM/group policy metadata, native file/artifact paths, attachment ingestion,
  Feishu websocket/webhook handling, Discord thread/group handling, and clearer
  channel health/status reporting.
- OpenSquilla can run as an inbound MCP server bridge for session workflows:
  clients can list sessions, resolve/read conversation history, send messages,
  and wait for session events through the gateway.
- Generated artifact delivery is more complete across WebUI and channels,
  including traceable generated-file delivery, recovered fallback delivery,
  channel-safe artifact text, and Unicode-safe PDF report rendering.
- Memory surfaces now separate curated memory from raw transcript search, recall
  prior-session evidence, keep manual Dream runs on configured memory
  workspaces, and let compaction continue when memory flush degrades.
- Release/install support now includes versioned release URLs,
  latest-download aliases, reproducible wheel/portable release guidance,
  source install scripts, Windows portable hardening, ONNX/router recovery
  messaging, and Docker/compose alignment on the gateway port.

### Changed

- Release installation docs now use 0.2.0 release asset URLs and
  `/releases/latest/download/` aliases for the current wheel and Windows
  portable zip.
- Cron tool calls now require structured schedule input (`{kind, ...}`) instead
  of backend natural-language schedule parsing. CLI cron flags still accept
  standard user-facing forms such as `--cron`, `--every`, `--at`, and
  `--expression` through RPC compatibility paths.
- Tool dispatch now runs through a policy pipeline with side-effect-aware
  concurrency: safe/read-only tools can batch, while mutating or
  side-effecting tools stay serialized, keyed, or capped.
- Long-running agent turns now use staged `TurnRunner` execution, provider
  request-budget compaction, prompt-cache anchor preservation, bounded
  tool-result storage, approval-aware retry handling, and recovery paths for
  malformed or non-executable tool calls.
- Channel adapters now declare normalized capability and error-taxonomy
  metadata so unsupported, degraded, retryable, and fatal channel behavior is
  surfaced more consistently.
- WebUI chat, sessions, usage, setup, cron, and search surfaces now share more
  runtime-backed state for recency ordering, per-turn token metrics, provider
  badges, setup form behavior, and session cancellation/readback.
- The default gateway/release documentation now centers on port `18791`, and
  release download paths use the current 0.2.0 assets.

### Fixed

- Failed or aborted turns are kept out of later provider context, reducing
  cascading failures after a bad turn.
- Approval-gated tool retries wait for operator decisions instead of exposing
  pending approval state as ordinary model-visible tool output.
- Provider-context tool markers are protected from becoming executable tool
  state.
- High-volume tool and chat turns recover more reliably from request-tail bloat,
  current-turn tool overflow, and provider payload budget pressure.
- Channel replies avoid leaking provider compaction markers, and channel cron
  delivery now reports failures explicitly.
- WebUI reliability fixes cover recency ordering, table boundaries, mobile and
  composer layout, duplicate visible toasts, setup form resilience, search
  provider badges, and session cancellation counters.
- Generated files that were omitted from normal delivery can be recovered
  through the artifact fallback path.
- Feishu-delivered PDF reports now render Unicode text instead of black or
  placeholder glyph blocks.

## [0.1.0rc1] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- OOTB startup path: `compose.yaml` + `start.sh` + `start.ps1` + Quickstart section in README.
- Legacy `memory.*` config fields: 16 deprecated keys silently dropped with a single aggregated `DeprecationWarning`.
- Agent CLI no-key error: three-section actionable panel (Symptom / Cause / Next steps).
- Tool concurrency: same-turn safe `tool_calls` dispatched concurrently via `asyncio.gather` (22 safe tools enrolled in `_SAFE_TOOL_NAMES`; mutex tools remain serial).
- PID file lock to prevent two gateway instances from sharing the same state directory.
- Core observability counters: `opensquilla_queue_depth`, `in_flight_turns_total`, `turn_cancellations_total`, `queue_full_errors_total`.
- CI matrix on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` × Python 3.11/3.12, including a metric-name drift check and a tracemalloc leak smoke step.
- Per-channel-adapter in-flight reply cap (`_ChannelInFlightSet`) so a single channel cannot exhaust the global concurrency budget.
- Cross-session fair queueing: sessions sharing an `agent_id` round-robin available slots by completion count.
- Session epoch counter so events from a pre-reset turn are discarded by the frontend after `session.reset`.
- Atomic write helper for transcript attachments (`_atomic_write_bytes`): tmp + fsync + `os.replace`.
- Concurrency env overrides — `OPENSQUILLA_TASK_MAX_CONCURRENCY` and `OPENSQUILLA_CHANNEL_INFLIGHT_CAP` — with invalid-value fallback and warning logs.

### Changed

- Internal SquillaRouter package moved from `opensquilla.contrib.squilla_router`
  to `opensquilla.squilla_router`; bundled model assets now live under
  `src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/`.
- `TurnRunner` and `TaskRuntime` share a single per-session `asyncio.Lock` (injected via `session_lock_provider`), removing the two-layer lock dictionary and the reverse-acquire risk it created.

### Fixed

- Channel adapter ghost-turn bug: a `TaskQueueFullError` no longer leaves a dangling user message in the transcript.
- `TaskRuntime` terminal-state dictionary leak across `_tasks`, `_session_locks`, and `_pending_by_session`.
