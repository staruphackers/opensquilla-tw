"""Config persistence: load/validate/atomic sparse write with backup + 0600 mode.

Persistence is diff-based: ``persist_config`` writes only the fields the
caller actually changed, merged onto the current on-disk TOML. Values that
merely reflect environment variables or built-in defaults (for example an
``OPENSQUILLA_AUTH_TOKEN`` picked up by a pydantic-settings default factory)
never leak into the file, small configs stay small, and non-conflicting
concurrent edits made by another writer between load and persist survive.

TOML comments are not preserved across a save: ``tomli_w`` has no comment
support, so a save rewrites the file without them (pre-existing limitation).
