"""Pre-turn step: enforce coding mode when the operator toggle is ON.

Coding mode is an UNCONDITIONAL operator toggle, not an intent classifier.
While it is ON, every turn gets a directive that steers code changes through
the code-task plugin (``opensquilla code-task solve``) instead of letting the
agent clone and hand-edit repositories itself (which skips the runner-verified
red→green proof). No per-message detection is performed: the directive is
injected on every turn while coding mode is on, and not at all while it is off.
