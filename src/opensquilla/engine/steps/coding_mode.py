"""Pre-turn step: enforce coding mode when the operator toggle is ON.

Coding mode is an UNCONDITIONAL operator toggle, not an intent classifier.
While it is ON, every turn gets a directive that steers code changes through
the code-task plugin (``opensquilla code-task solve``) instead of letting the
agent clone and hand-edit repositories itself (which skips the runner-verified
red→green proof). No per-message detection is performed: the directive is
injected on every turn while coding mode is on, and not at all while it is off.

    "For building an app or UI from scratch (e.g. an Electron + React "
    "desktop app), add --verification-mode build so code-task verifies the "
    "app compiles and packages instead of running red->green tests.\n"
    "BUILD-FROM-SCRATCH — ASK BRIEFLY WHEN THE REQUEST IS ONLY A CATEGORY: "
    "decide by whether you know WHAT THE APP SHOULD DO, not just what kind it "
    "is. If the request gives only a broad app type or goal with no concrete "
    "features, target user, or scope (e.g. 'make me an English-learning app', "
    "'build a drawing app', 'make me an app'), ASK 1-2 focused questions — most "
    "usefully its core features/screens and who it is for — and STOP this turn "
    "(do NOT call code-task until the user answers). If the request already "
    "names concrete features, scope, or target users, do NOT ask — build it, "
    "choosing sensible defaults for the rest and briefly stating your "
    "assumptions. NEVER ask about platform, framework, or styling; just default "
    "those. Keep it to at most 2 questions and never interrogate. (Concrete bug "
    "fixes or feature changes in a named repo never need this.)\n"
    "For a follow-up change to an app you already built (e.g. add a section "
    "or change the color), point --repo at that app's repo and keep "
    "--verification-mode build; code-task edits the existing app in place and "
    "applies the verified change back to the repo so the next edit builds on it.\n"
    "code-task usually runs for several minutes; if you launch it via "
    'background_process, await it with process(action="wait", session_id=...) '
    "rather than polling process(action=\"poll\") in a loop.\n"
    "code-task works in an ISOLATED run directory, NOT in the --repo source you "
    "pass it: that source stays EMPTY until a run finishes and VERIFIES, then "
    "the change is committed back. So do NOT judge progress by the source "
    "repo's files and do NOT conclude it is 'stuck' because the source looks "
    "empty. Let process(action=\"wait\") return the result — do NOT kill the "
    "run, do NOT 'clean and retry', and do NOT launch the same task again while "
    "one is still running. Decide success ONLY from the returned result (its "
    "state and build.installer_path, which point into the run directory); the "
    "run prints its run directory on startup and writes live progress to "
    "<run_dir>/status.json.\n"
    "Do NOT clone the repository yourself and do NOT hand-edit its files in "
    "this session: the file-editing tools (write_file, edit_file, apply_patch, "
    "execute_code, git_commit, create_*) are DISABLED while coding mode is on, and "
    "in-session edits skip code-task's isolation and the "
    "runner-verified red→green proof, so they are not equivalent and are not "
    "allowed while coding mode is on. Read-only requests (showing structure, "
    "explaining code) and ordinary conversation are answered normally."
