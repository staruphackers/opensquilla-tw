"""Pipeline step + store for the manual ``/meta`` command launch path.

The ``/meta`` command surface does NOT start a meta-skill turn directly.
Instead the ``meta.run`` RPC stamps a *pending launch* into a small
session-keyed, in-process store; the surface then sends a normal turn.
On that next turn the :func:`meta_command_launch` pipeline step pops the
pending launch and writes ``ctx.metadata["meta_launch"] = {"name": ...}``,
which the agent bootstrap stage copies onto ``config.metadata`` so the
agent's turn generator dispatches ``Agent._run_meta_launch(name)``.

The store is intentionally minimal:

* keyed by session id (the pipeline's ``session_key``);
* one-shot — :func:`pending_meta_launch_pop` consumes the entry atomically
  so a launch fires on exactly one turn;
* in-memory only (lost on gateway restart, which is fine: a restart drops
  any half-issued ``/meta`` command and the surface can re-issue it);
* claimed only by its own launch turn — every surface stamps the launch and
  then sends a turn whose text is the ``/meta <name>`` sentinel, so
  :func:`meta_command_launch` consumes the pending entry only when the turn
  message matches that sentinel. A stale stamp (whose launch turn never
  arrived) is never drained by an unrelated normal turn, so it cannot hijack
  the next ordinary message.

The locking pattern mirrors the sticky-cache helpers in
``opensquilla.engine.steps.meta_resolution`` (``_sticky_get`` /
``_sticky_put`` / ``_sticky_drop``).
