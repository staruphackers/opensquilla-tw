          Expand the user-confirmed travel facts into a full planning contract.

        task: |
          Build the primary day-by-day itinerary. It must be complete enough
          to use without reading any later step.

          Include:
          - assumptions
          - one section per day with morning / afternoon / evening
          - neighborhood grouping and transit notes
          - food suggestions
          - rain-aware risks and substitutions
          - rough budget notes

          Trip preferences:
          {{ outputs.trip_preferences | truncate(1200) }}

          Weather forecast:
          {{ outputs.weather | truncate(2000) }}

          POI search:

      with:
        system: "You assemble complete travel plans for users. Return only the final answer."
        task: |
          Assemble the complete travel product. Do not return only variants.
          Do not include process commentary.
          Return every required section. Keep the whole answer compact enough
          to fit in one model response: 4,500-6,500 characters is preferred.
          If space is tight, shorten day descriptions before omitting the
          variants, evidence, next-step, or artifact sections.

          Required sections:
          1. Assumptions
          2. Primary itinerary matching the requested or inferred trip length
          3. Weather-aware risks and rain backups
          4. Variants
          5. Budget and booking notes
          6. Evidence and source notes
          7. Next steps

          Preserve concrete timings, neighborhoods, transit grouping, food
          ideas, weather constraints, and budget constraints. Do not open with
          "I researched" or imply live verification unless a tool result is
          shown in the evidence notes. Keep each day to 5-7 highly actionable
          bullets or a compact schedule. Include:
          - a Route spine line for each day, e.g. Neighborhood A -> B -> C
          - no more than 2-3 main anchors per day unless the user requested a
            packed pace
          - an explicit pacing note: relaxed/balanced/packed and what to skip
            if tired
          - transit-coherent neighborhood adjacency; avoid cross-city zigzags
          - relaxed version
          - efficient/packed version
          - bad-weather backup
          - weather switch points: if rain/heavy heat, swap X for Y
          - rough daily budget notes
          - specific checks before booking, including opening-hours checks,
            timed-entry reservations, and transit-pass choice
          - mark specific restaurants, opening hours, and seasonal events as
            "verify before booking" unless they came from explicit search
            evidence in this run
          - a short note that a styled HTML itinerary can be generated only if
            the user explicitly asks for a file

          If search or weather evidence is thin, state assumptions plainly
          instead of inventing sources. Include map/search links only as
          plain URLs when useful. Use the words Evidence, Source notes,
          Reference checks, Next steps, Verify, HTML, and Report
          only where they fit naturally in the final sections.

          Itinerary:
          {{ outputs.itinerary | truncate(7000) }}

          Constraint notes:
          {{ outputs.constraints | truncate(2500) }}

          Weather evidence:
          {{ outputs.weather | truncate(1600) }}

          POI/source notes:
          {{ outputs.poi | truncate(2000) }}

# Travel Planner (Meta-Skill)

Weather + POI/restaurant/transport search + constraints + a complete itinerary
with variants. The default answer is a complete travel plan; HTML export is an
optional handoff when the user explicitly asks for a file.

## Fallback

Manually call weather, multi-search-engine, summarize. If the user explicitly
asks for HTML export, ask the LLM to write a styled `travel-itinerary.html`
and `publish_artifact` it.
