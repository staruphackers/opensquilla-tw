description: "Use this meta-skill instead of answering directly when the current user asks to draft, repair, compile, or produce an academic/research paper or LaTeX manuscript. It uses multi-skill orchestration for manuscript workflows that need source search, citation planning, experiment or figure/table placeholders, drafting, length checks, citation integrity, and LaTeX/PDF compilation. Ordinary paper requests use a compact draft path; explicit full/PDF/long-form requests use the full manuscript path. Do not use it for web research reports, slide decks, document decisions, or generic plotting."

        system: "You extract paper requirements and decide whether clarification is required."
        task: |
          Extract a structured paper brief from the original user request.
          Do NOT ask a question in this step. Instead, mark
          NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: yes when any required field is missing,
          ambiguous, or only guessable. The next paper_clarify step will
          ask the user for missing information.

          Mode defaults:
          - Use COMPACT_SKELETON by default for ordinary "write/draft a
            paper" requests. This is the fast path and still produces a
            coherent LaTeX-ready draft with citations and a compiled PDF.
          - Use FULL_MANUSCRIPT only when the user explicitly asks for a full
            manuscript, long-form paper, publication-ready paper, PDF, LaTeX
            manuscript, section-by-section drafting, or gives a target of 8+
            pages.
          - Use COMPACT_SKELETON when the user explicitly asks for a short
            skeleton, outline, compact draft, or does not specify length.
          - Use REPAIR_EXISTING only when the user provides or references an
            existing manuscript to fix.
          - Use COMPILE_ONLY only when the user explicitly asks only to compile
            an existing LaTeX manuscript.

          Clarification policy:
          - Required field: topic.
          - Infer language from the user request whenever possible. For an
            English request, set LANGUAGE: en. For a Chinese request, set
            LANGUAGE: zh.
          - If target pages are missing, use TARGET_PAGES: 4 for
            COMPACT_SKELETON and 10 for FULL_MANUSCRIPT.
          - If audience is missing, use AUDIENCE: academic.
          - Set NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: yes only when the topic is missing or
            the request explicitly asks to be interviewed before drafting.
          - Do not set NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: yes for missing paper_mode,
            language, target_pages, citation_target, or audience; apply the
            defaults above instead.
          - If clarification is required, write CLARIFY_QUESTION in the same
            language as the original request. For English requests, the
            question must be English.

          {{ outputs.table_placeholders | truncate(1500) }}

          Length/citation budget rules:
          - Treat paper_preferences.LENGTH_STRATEGY and TARGET_LENGTH as
            authoritative; do not use a fixed default page or word budget when
            the user requested a different length.
          - This writing plan is the length-control point. Solve length by
            allocating enough section scope, subclaims, evidence, analysis,
            and limitations now; do not assume a downstream checker will fix
            an undersized manuscript later.
          - Convert the requested compiled-page target into an approximate
            total word budget using the paper language, figure/table count,
            and venue style. For normal academic article formatting, set the
            minimum total target_words to at least TARGET_PAGES × 820 English
            words (or the equivalent dense prose units for non-English text).
            Do not reduce below TARGET_PAGES × 760 for figures/tables; instead
            add analysis, limitations, related-work synthesis, and method detail.
          - Allocate words across sections according to the requested paper
            type and contribution shape. A method-heavy paper should give
            more budget to Method; an empirical paper should give more to
            Experiments/Results; a survey should give more to Related Work.
          - The sum of PER_SECTION_BLUEPRINT.*.target_words must meet or
            exceed the minimum total target_words implied by TARGET_PAGES. If
            the target is 12 pages, the blueprint should normally allocate at
            least 9,840 total words across abstract/introduction/related_work/
            method/experiments/discussion/conclusion.
          - In every PER_SECTION_BLUEPRINT entry, target_words is a
            lower-bound writing budget. It is not a ceiling. Give each
            section enough planned subclaims, paragraphs, evidence, analysis,
            and transitions that a section author can satisfy at least 90% of
            target_words without padding.
          - Do not return an undersized section from any non-abstract section author.
          - Treat paper_preferences.CITATION_TARGET and CITATION_STRATEGY as
            authoritative. If they are AUTO, derive a citation budget
            proportional to target length and available verified references;
            never invent citations to hit a count.
          - Return explicit per-section target_words and cite_keys budgets
            that downstream section authors must obey.

          - Introduce notation per writing_plan.NOTATION_LOCK
            (every symbol used later in experiments/discussion MUST
            be defined here).
          - You may inline ONE figure environment from figure_placeholders
            that supports method exposition; reference it via \ref{fig:<id>}.
          - Match TERMINOLOGY_LOCK / NOTATION_LOCK exactly.
          - target_words from writing_plan.PER_SECTION_BLUEPRINT.method.target_words.
          - Length floor: target_words is a lower-bound writing budget. Do
            not return until the section reaches at least 90% of target_words;
            expand with plan-aligned assumptions, definitions, algorithmic
            detail, instrumentation, and reproducibility notes if short. Do

          - Use writing_plan.PLACEHOLDER_RESULT_TOKEN for the headline
            evidence claim. Do not state exact numeric improvements,
            percentages, scores, latency reductions, or win rates unless

          Draft a full manuscript package. The default output must be clean
          LaTeX-ready paper text, not planning notes. Do not include markdown
          fences, chat commentary, progress notes, or tool logs.

          Paper mode:
          TOPIC: {{ outputs.paper_contract | truncate(1200) }}, MODE: {{ outputs.paper_contract | truncate(400) }}, PAGES: {{ outputs.paper_contract | truncate(400) }}

          Mode behavior:
          - FULL_MANUSCRIPT: produce enough substance for
            TARGET_LENGTH from paper_preferences as compiled pages, using
            the user-requested or derived CITATION_TARGET instead of a fixed
            reference count. Distribute verified citation keys across
            abstract, introduction, related work, method, results, discussion,
            limitations, and conclusion.
          - COMPACT_SKELETON: produce a compact LaTeX-ready manuscript
            skeleton with section goals, planned citations, and expansion
            notes; do not pretend it is a finished paper of the requested
            length. For this
            mode, the final package MUST include an explicit manuscript plan,
            a target-length expansion plan, limitations/threats-to-validity,
            and reference placeholders sized to the requested/derived citation
            strategy when verified BibTeX entries are unavailable. Keep the compact package short enough that all
            required sections are visible before any evaluator truncation:
            put the plan and expansion plan before the LaTeX skeleton, and
            keep MANUSCRIPT_TEX under 2,500 words.
          - REPAIR_EXISTING: return a repaired clean LaTeX package focused on
            citation integrity, structure, and removal of process text.
          - COMPILE_ONLY: return a compile handoff package and blockers only;
            do not invent missing manuscript body.

          CITATION CONTRACT (load-bearing):
          - DO NOT invent cite keys. Use ONLY keys that appear verbatim in
            REFERENCES_BIB below.
          - DO NOT cite a key that REFERENCES_BIB does not contain.
          - Every claim that needs evidence MUST cite at least one key from
            REFERENCES_BIB.
          - Distribute citations according to paper_preferences.CITATION_STRATEGY;
            avoid repeatedly citing one key when enough verified sources exist.
          - If REFERENCES_BIB is empty or lacks enough verified entries, do
            not emit \cite{...}. Use visible placeholders such as
            [REF-01 needed: agent benchmark survey] in the LaTeX text and
            list them under REFERENCE_PLACEHOLDERS instead. Placeholder
            references are safer than fabricated BibTeX.

          FIGURE/TABLE CONTRACT:
          - Inline the figure_placeholders block verbatim into Results.
          - Inline the table_placeholders block verbatim into Method or
            Results (split by purpose).
          - Inline the analysis_outline block verbatim into Discussion.
          - Reference figures/tables via \\ref{fig:<id>} and \\ref{tab:<id>}
            where they appear in the body; never reference an id not present
            in the placeholders.

          Paper preferences:
          {{ outputs.paper_preferences | truncate(2000) }}

          Outline:
          {{ outputs.outline | truncate(8000) }}

          Citation plan:
          {{ outputs.citation_plan | truncate(8000) }}

          Figure placeholders (inline this verbatim somewhere in Results):
          {{ outputs.figure_placeholders | truncate(4000) }}

          Table placeholders (inline this verbatim in Method/Results):
          {{ outputs.table_placeholders | truncate(4000) }}

          Analysis outline (inline this verbatim in Discussion):
          {{ outputs.analysis_outline | truncate(4000) }}

          Bibliography (cite keys MUST come from here):
          {{ outputs.refbib | truncate(8000) }}

          CRITICAL OUTPUT CONTRACT (load-bearing — the downstream
          compile_pdf step parses these markers literally):

          - The MANUSCRIPT_TEX section is MANDATORY and MUST come first.
            It MUST start with the literal token `MANUSCRIPT_TEX:` on its
            own line, immediately followed by `\documentclass{article}`
            and end with `\end{document}`. Do NOT wrap in ```latex
            fences. Do NOT prefix with markdown headings.
          - If you find yourself running out of tokens, shorten section
            bodies — DO NOT omit MANUSCRIPT_TEX. A short complete
            \documentclass…\end{document} block is FAR more useful than
            a long MANUSCRIPT_PLAN with no LaTeX.
          - REFERENCES_BIB is the second mandatory section. Use
            `REFERENCES_BIB:` on its own line followed by BibTeX entries.
            If the bibliography is empty, output `REFERENCES_BIB:`
            followed by a single line `% no verified references` (the
            \cite{} keys in MANUSCRIPT_TEX should then be visible
            placeholders, not BibTeX-keyed cites).

          Return EXACTLY in this order (no preamble, no markdown headings):

          MANUSCRIPT_TEX:

          \usepackage{xeCJK}

            paper_preferences.CITATION_STRATEGY; do not enforce a fixed count

          - every cited entry MUST have a verifiable URL or DOI or arXiv
            eprint field in REFERENCES_BIB; entries with only howpublished
            text are degraded but acceptable; entries with no URL/DOI/eprint

# meta-paper-write (Meta-Skill)

Draft a long LaTeX manuscript by orchestrating paper-specific skills and
bounded LLM synthesis. The pipeline now leads with explicit experiment
design + placeholder figures/tables + citation provenance audit so the
deliverable can be reviewed for academic rigor, not just length.

DAG (in order):

1. **`paper_collect`** — extracts topic, mode, language, target length,
   audience, and reference count from the same turn without pausing for a
   form. Missing facts are marked as assumptions so first-pass paper
   requests complete inline.
2. **`paper_preferences`** — expand the collected facts into a planning
   contract.
3. **`search_papers`** — `multi-search-engine` query biased toward arXiv
   / ACL Anthology / ACM DL / OpenReview / IEEE / Nature / Science so
   the returned URLs translate into real bibliographic identifiers.
4. **`refbib`** — `paper-refbib-stub` now extracts ``eprint``/``doi``
   from arXiv/DOI URLs and tags each entry with ``note = {source: <domain>}``
   so downstream gates can classify provenance without re-fetching.
5. **`source_pack`** — curate references and enforce ≥20-source coverage.
6. **`experiment_design`** — **decides** how many figures and tables the
   paper needs based on RQs, hypotheses, analysis dimensions, and the
   target page budget. Every figure/table is tied to an RQ or analysis
   dimension; no decorative artefacts.
7. **`figure_placeholders`** — render LaTeX ``\fbox{\parbox{...}}``
   placeholder figure environments for each entry in FIGURE_PLAN. Zero
   matplotlib dependency.
8. **`table_placeholders`** — render LaTeX ``\begin{tabular}`` placeholder
   tables for each entry in TABLE_PLAN. Cells contain ``---``/``<TBD>``;
   no fabricated numbers.
9. **`analysis_outline`** — bind every figure/table id to a Discussion
   subsection that names potential findings + threats to validity, and
   covers every ANALYSIS_DIMENSION.
10. **`outline`** — paper outline that ties Method to experiment design
    and Results to the figure/table plan.
11. **`citation_plan`** — assigns concrete cite keys from `refbib` to
    claims; cannot invent keys.
12. **`writing_plan` + section authors** — the explicit FULL_MANUSCRIPT path
    converts the user's page target into section-level `target_words` and
    citation budgets before prose is written; section authors obey that plan.
13. **`final_manuscript_package`** — compact / repair modes produce
    MANUSCRIPT_TEX with the figure/table/analysis blocks inlined verbatim,
    plus REFERENCES_BIB containing only the entries actually cited.
14. **`citation_map`** — strict markdown audit table:
    ``Cite Key | Cited Times | Title | URL/DOI/arXiv | Source Quality``
    with INVALID / UNUSED / WEAK detection. Inlined into the final
    deliverable AND queryable per-run via
    ``opensquilla skills meta runs show``.
15. **`citation_integrity_gate`** — reads `citation_map` directly; blocks
    when INVALID > 0 or any primary claim cites a WEAK source.
16. **`latex_sanitizer`** — strips process text without rewriting the
    paper.
17. **`compile_pdf` / `publish_pdf` / `deliver_paper`** — compile and
    publish the final PDF for FULL_MANUSCRIPT, COMPACT_SKELETON, and
    REPAIR_EXISTING. The compiler refuses to create degraded PDFs when
    MANUSCRIPT_TEX is missing.
18. **`compile_latex`** — handoff note (COMPILE_ONLY mode).

Removed from the previous version:

- `paper_mode` (llm_classify) — superseded by `paper_collect`
- `experiment` (skill_exec → `paper-experiment-stub`, fake CSV) —
  superseded by `experiment_design` (real plan, not data). The
  bundled `paper-experiment-stub` skill was deleted with this rewrite.
- `plot` (skill_exec → `paper-plot-stub`, matplotlib line chart) —
  superseded by `figure_placeholders` (zero-dependency LaTeX). The
  bundled `paper-plot-stub` skill was deleted with this rewrite.

The default path is COMPACT_SKELETON and ends with a compiled PDF without
section-by-section drafting. Explicit full/PDF/long-form requests use
FULL_MANUSCRIPT. If the topic is missing, `paper_clarify` pauses and asks the
user before generation continues. The compiler refuses to synthesize a degraded
PDF when the manuscript contract is missing.
