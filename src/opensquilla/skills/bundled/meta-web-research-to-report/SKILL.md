description: "Use this meta-skill instead of answering directly when the current user asks for a source-backed web research deliverable: cited research report, market or technical briefing, decision memo with sources, or a researched writeup after web lookup. It uses multi-skill orchestration for preference inference, search/research, drafting, review, and optional export. Do not use it for generic summarization, academic manuscript writing, document-decision analysis, or isolated fact lookup that does not require a report."

          Infer the report contract from the request. If details are missing,
          choose conservative defaults and mark them as assumptions instead of
          asking follow-up questions. Set NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: yes only when the topic is too broad

          report but the audience or decision context is missing. Do not ask
          for citation style, length, or language when a conservative default
          works.

          Clarification answers (may be empty when not needed):
          {{ inputs.get('collected', {}).get('report_clarify', {}) | tojson }}

          Decision rules:
          - QUICK_DECISION_MEMO: user wants a concise answer, quick brief,
            compact research report, planning-meeting memo, comparison memo,
            CTO/leadership decision aid, or explicitly says compact/concise/
            paste into a decision memo. Prefer this even when the phrase
            "research report" appears.
          - DEEP_REPORT: user wants a comprehensive, long, detailed, or
            multi-round source-backed report/briefing/writeup and did not
            explicitly request a file export.
          - EXPORT_DOCX: user explicitly asks for a Word/docx/file/report
            artifact export.

        system: "You prepare conservative source targets for later verification."
        task: |
          Produce a compact list of official or near-official source targets
          that should be checked for this report. This is a fallback and
          query-planning aid, not proof that the source was checked.

          User request:
          {{ inputs.user_message | xml_escape | truncate(2000) }}

          Preferences:
          {{ outputs.preferences | truncate(1200) }}

          Rules:
          - Prefer official sources: regulator/agency pages, vendor pricing
            pages, product docs, carrier pages, destination tourism boards,
            standards bodies, or primary company docs.
          - For travel-connectivity decisions, include source target categories
            for home-carrier roaming pages, destination tourism-board internet
            guidance, eSIM provider official plan pages, and local carrier
            tourist SIM pages.
          - Include a URL only when it is a likely stable official homepage or
            obvious product page. Mark every URL as "verification target, not
            live-checked" unless it appears in the live search output later.
          - Do not infer current prices, coverage, availability, or support
            quality from this seed list.

          Return:
          SOURCE_TARGETS:
            - <title> — <URL or no URL> — verification target, not live-checked

          Do not mention tool names, connector failures, workspaces, working
          directories, provider errors, or internal meta-skill mechanics.
          Say that live source verification was not completed and that the
          final memo must clearly mark evidence limits instead of inventing
          current prices, providers, or availability.

        task: |
          Rank and deduplicate these web results for report writing.
          Prefer primary sources, official docs, reputable publications, and
          recent sources when the topic is time-sensitive. Remove low-quality
          SEO pages and repeated mirrors.

          Report preferences:
          {{ outputs.preferences | truncate(1200) }}

          Source targets (fallback/query planning only, not live-checked
          unless repeated in search results):
          {{ outputs.source_seed | truncate(3000) }}

          Search results:
          {{ outputs.search | truncate(8000) }}

          Return a concise numbered source pack with 8-15 sources. For each
          source, include:
          [S#] Title — URL
          Credibility: <why this source is usable>
          Supports: <specific claim(s)>
          Evidence type: <direct|indirect|background>

          If a search result lacks a URL, omit it. Do not create placeholder
          source numbers. Prefer fewer credible sources over many weak ones.
          If live search returned no usable URLs, create a separate section
          titled "Verification targets, not live-checked" from the source
          targets. These may be used in the final answer only as tonight's
          check list or evidence limits, not as proof for factual claims.
          For quick decision memos, prioritize the best 5-8 sources over a
          long source list. Prefer official/vendor docs, standards, primary
          surveys, reputable engineering publications, and current release
          notes. Avoid Reddit, anonymous forums, content farms, and generic SEO
          listicles as primary evidence; include them only as background or
          evidence-limit notes when no stronger source exists.
          Label secondary roundup/blog/stat pages as indirect/background unless
          they are the source of the specific statistic being used. Do not let
          indirect sources support causal, benchmark, cost, or adoption claims
          without an explicit caveat.

          the source pack, e.g. [S1], [S3]. Do not cite source numbers that
          are absent from the source pack.
          For each major claim, mark SUPPORT as DIRECT, INDIRECT, or
          INFERENCE. Claims with INDIRECT/INFERENCE support must be phrased as
          caveats or removed from the final recommendation.

          If acceptable, return the polished report body. If not, repair it

          commentary.
          The repaired report must include a visible "Sources" or "Source
          list" section with source titles and URLs. If the draft references
          numbered sources, the same numbers must appear in that source list.

          - QUICK_DECISION_MEMO: concise decision memo with bullets, sources,
            and caveats.
          - DEEP_REPORT: full cited report with executive summary, findings,
            evidence, limitations, and sources.

          Polished report or quick memo draft:
          {{ (outputs.get('quality_gate') or outputs.get('report_draft') or '') | truncate(10000) }}

          Final output contract:
          - Never return JSON, artifact references, attachment metadata,
            download URLs, or a wrapper like {"text": ..., "artifacts": ...}.
          - Never mention workflow, meta-skill, tool names, connector failures,
            workspace paths, working directory problems, or runtime details.
          - Preserve the user's language. If the request is in English, write
            the memo/report in English with English section headings only; do
            not default to Chinese or bilingual headings. If the request is in
            Chinese, write Simplified Chinese and do not default to English.
          - Never say the memo was saved, exported, attached, generated as a
            file, or available via artifact unless the user explicitly asked
            for DOCX/file export and the export step ran.
          - For decision-memo requests, keep it compact and memo-ready:
            use exactly these top-level sections in this order:
            Assumptions / Decision Context; Recommendation; Five Key Findings;
            Practical Risks / Tradeoffs; Evidence Limits / 证据局限; Next Steps; Sources.
            Keep the body under 900 words before the Sources section unless
            the user asks for a long report.
          - The Assumptions / Decision Context section must explicitly state
            the audience, decision being made, scope, and key assumptions from
            the preferences step. Do not omit this section when the user asks
            for assumptions, CTO context, planning context, or a decision memo.
          - The Five Key Findings section must contain exactly five numbered
            findings when the user asks for five. Each finding must cite at
            least one source ID or explicitly say "inference from [S#]" /
            "not directly proven by the source pack".
          - Treat the Source pack below as authoritative evidence input. If
            the Polished report says no sources were provided but the Source
            pack contains `[S#] Title — URL` entries, ignore that sentence and
            restore sources from the Source pack.
          - The Source list must copy title + URL entries from the Source pack
            verbatim or near-verbatim. Never output "No sources were provided"
            unless the Source pack is empty or contains no URLs.
          - Include a visible Source list with title + URL for every cited
            source ID. Do not cite [S#] or "Source #N" unless that source
            appears in the Source list.
          - Every non-obvious quantitative claim must be cited or explicitly
            marked as an assumption/inference. Remove invented cost, latency,
            benchmark, plan-price, availability, or quality numbers that are
            not supported by the source pack.
          - Key findings must cite only source IDs that appear in the Source
            list. When evidence is indirect, say "inference" or "not directly
            proven by the source pack" in the finding or limitations.
          - Add a short Evidence limits note when the source pack relies on
            secondary or indirect sources for strategic claims.
          - Do not use Reddit, anonymous forums, or generic listicles to support
            the final recommendation unless explicitly framed as anecdotal or
            background evidence. Prefer to omit them from Sources for quick
            decision memos when stronger sources exist.
          - If sources are weak or stale, say so in Limitations instead of
            overstating certainty.
          - Do not announce that a file was generated unless the user explicitly
            asked for DOCX/file export and the export step ran. For ordinary
            memo requests, the final chat reply must contain the complete memo
            body inline.

            Chinese requests, write Simplified Chinese and do not switch to
            English headings.
          - Remove phrases such as "元技能", "meta-skill", "workflow",
            "工作流", "工作目录", "workspace", "connector", "tool failure",
            "手动做研究", "信息收集充分", and any runtime apology.
          - Never mention workflow, meta-skill, tool names, connector failures,
            workspace paths, working directory problems, or runtime details.
          - Never mention workflow, meta-skill, tool names, connector failures, workspace paths, or runtime details.
          - For the Japan eSIM/roaming/local SIM decision-memo pattern, include
            the requested sections: assumptions/decision context,
            recommendation, key findings, risks/tradeoffs, evidence limits,
            next steps for tonight, and how to teach parents to use it.
          - Use the exact heading "Evidence Limits / 证据局限" for evidence
            limits so readers and automated checks can find the caveats.
          - Include visible source titles and URLs copied from the source pack
            when source URLs are available. If live verification was limited,
            say that clearly and avoid invented current prices or availability.
          - If the source pack only has verification targets, include them in
            "Sources / 来源" as "to check tonight, not live-verified" and do
            not cite them as support for exact prices.
          - Do not create, save, export, attach, or claim a file for ordinary
            memo requests.

# Web Research to Report (Meta-Skill)

Produce a cited Word report from a single research question. The workflow
first derives the report contract, ranks sources, drafts from an outline, and
runs a readiness gate before exporting.

## Fallback

If the orchestrator fails, the LLM should manually drive each step using
the corresponding skill's SKILL.md as guidance.
