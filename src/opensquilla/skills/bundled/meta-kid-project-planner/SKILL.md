description: "Use this meta-skill instead of answering directly when the current user asks for a child-appropriate school project, show-and-tell object, classroom demonstration, science fair idea, hobby kit, or kid-sized creative activity. It keeps ordinary parent/guardian requests short, uses durable child memory when available, refuses unsafe topics, and can generate one child-safe cover illustration when explicitly requested. Do not use it for adult maker projects, generic science explanations, family scheduling, or pasted old project examples."

          For safe projects:
          - Return the complete response inline in chat.
          - Do not create, save, export, attach, or claim downloadable files.
          - Never mention workflow, meta-skill, tool names, connector failures,
            workspace paths, or runtime details.
          - Preserve every explicit user constraint: age, deadline, available
            materials, budget, parent time, requested sheet/script/image, and
            "finish tonight" or "few steps" constraints.
          - Use remembered child facts when present, but weave them into
            choices instead of listing memory unless the user asked what memory
            was used.
          - Use quick_reference only for safe, generic project inspiration.
            Do not cite it as live-verified science unless it clearly contains
            a source. If it is missing or weak, ignore it.
          - Do not invent calendar dates. Do not invent exact calendar dates, weather, school rules,
            measurements, allergies, local forecasts, or fake sample data.
          - If the user gives only a relative deadline, do not convert it into a calendar date.
          - Do not prefill observation tables with fake measurements; leave measurement cells blank or as placeholders.
          - Do not suggest tasting or eating the experiment materials.
          - Prefer a clear comparison design when it fits: same container,
            same water, same paper towel/soil, one changed variable.
          - Treat requests for a printable worksheet as print-ready markdown included inline. "Printable" means a clean markdown table,
            checklist, or fill-in sheet that can be copied or printed. Do not
            create or refer to PDFs, HTML files, downloads, or attachments
            unless the user explicitly asked for a file/PDF/export/download.

          For English one-evening school projects due tomorrow/tonight, use
          this compact one-evening school-project structure and keep the whole
          answer about 350-650 words:

          # <warm project title>
          One short line explaining why it is low-stress and school-ready.
          ## Make this
          Name one concrete artifact, give it a memorable title, say what goes
          on the front, and include a memorable visual theme.
          ## Tonight plan
          Exactly 3-4 main steps, timed for 30-40 minutes. Use simple
          child-facing actions and include one parent line to say aloud per
          step.
          ## Tiny observation sheet
          A very small blank table/checklist the child can fill in tonight;
          make it a drawing-heavy record sheet if memory says she likes
          drawing.
          ## What she can say in class
          3-5 short lines, using "I noticed...", "I predicted...", and
          "I learned..." when appropriate.
          ## Illustration
          If the user asked for image/illustration/poster/visual/配图, say to
          use the generated image as the cover/front image, then give one
          sentence of alt text. Do not expose artifact metadata, file paths,
          IDs, hashes, or download URLs.

          Layout rules for one-evening school projects:
          - Make the answer look like a one-page project card, not a report.
          - Use a short title, compact sections, and scannable markdown.
          - Prefer one small table and one short checklist over paragraphs.
          - Use simple labels a child can copy onto paper: Cover, Tonight,
            My Weather Clue, I Noticed, I Learned.
          - Keep each numbered step to 1-2 short sentences.
          - Add a tiny front-cover layout line such as: top title, center
            picture, bottom 3 weather words.
          - Keep whitespace clean; no dense walls of text.

          For Chinese safe school projects, use concise Simplified Chinese
          headings and the same short shape: 做什么、今晚步骤、小记录表、上台怎么说、配图建议.

          For casual at-home activities, keep it warmer and shorter:
          # <warm activity title>
          ## What you need
          ## 20-minute plan
          ## If she gets stuck
          ## Optional 10-minute extension
          ## Why it works

          Avoid report-like sections unless the user explicitly asks for a
          full pack, detailed steps, research, poster-board layout, weather
          adjustment, safety review, rubric, vocabulary cards, slide deck, or
          multi-day plan.

          If Route is HEAVY_PROJECT_PACK, provide a fuller but still
          user-facing pack. Include only requested heavy sections from this
          list: known facts and assumptions, detailed plan, materials and
          substitutes, safety and failure modes, worksheet, poster layout,
          simple science explanation, weather/light adjustment, parent check,
          sources or evidence limits, slides/PPT note. Keep it grounded in the
          user request, memory, heavy_research, and weather_check. Do not
          include weather claims unless weather_check contains a real result.

# meta-kid-project-planner

Lightweight child-project planner for ordinary parent requests. The main path
is intentionally short:

Light route:

`preferences -> feasibility -> project_route -> memory recall + quick_reference -> project_pack -> visual_brief -> image_generate`

Heavy route:

`preferences -> feasibility -> project_route -> memory recall + quick_reference + heavy_research (+ weather_check when location exists) -> project_pack -> optional pptx/image_generate`

The previous heavy composition (full web research, weather lookup, fact ledger,
outline, materials, safety, learning objectives, PPTX deck, vocab cards,
deliver, audit) was removed from the default flow because ordinary school-night
requests need a fast usable answer, not a full report. The skill still records
its ClawHub component lineage in metadata, but ordinary execution now uses a
small reference check, memory, and optional image generation.

## Safety

`preferences` and `feasibility` reject clearly inappropriate projects. Unsafe
requests route to `redirect_unsafe`, and `project_pack` returns only the clean
redirect.

## Memory

`recall_past_projects` reads durable memory for child age, preferences, parent
time, prior projects, and planning rules. The final answer uses those facts
quietly unless the user explicitly asks to see memory.

## Images

When the user asks for 配图, image, illustration, poster, visual, cover, or front
art, `visual_brief` creates one child-safe image prompt and `project_illustration`
calls `image_generate`. The final markdown tells the user to use the generated
image as the cover/front image without exposing artifact metadata.
