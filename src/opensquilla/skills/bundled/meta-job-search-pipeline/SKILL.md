It produces reviewable text/artifacts and never auto-applies. Do not use it for generic career advice, generic resume comments without a target role/JD, or pasted historical job-search examples."

        task: |
          Tailor the candidate's resume to the target role.

          Target JD:
          {{ inputs.get('collected', {}).get('job_clarify', {}).get('job_posting', '') | xml_escape | truncate(3000) }}
          If that field is empty, extract the JD summary from the user request:
          {{ inputs.user_message | xml_escape | truncate(3000) }}

          Candidate's current resume:
          {{ inputs.get('collected', {}).get('job_clarify', {}).get('resume_text', '') | xml_escape | truncate(3500) }}
          If that field is empty, extract the resume facts from the user request:
          {{ inputs.user_message | xml_escape | truncate(3500) }}

          Company brief (use to phrase impact statements appropriately):
          {{ outputs.get('enrich_company', '') | truncate(800) }}

          Strict source fact ledger:
          {{ outputs.get('source_fact_ledger', '') | truncate(2500) }}

          Past research / notes on this company (from durable memory):
          {{ outputs.get('recall_company', '') | truncate(600) }}

          Candidate seniority:
          {{ inputs.get('collected', {}).get('job_clarify', {}).get('candidate_level', 'MID') }}

          Hard rules:
          - Keep every fact in the candidate's resume verifiable; reorder
            and rephrase, do NOT invent.
          - Do not add unprovided tools, methods, outcomes, or metrics
            such as A/B testing, NPS, customer interviews, Jira,
            Confluence, HubSpot, ticket reduction, release-note ownership,
            FAQ impact, 100% delivery, AI accuracy evaluation, dialogue-log
            review, technical-team work, product/design collaboration,
            leadership, or company names unless they appear in the source.
          - Avoid overclaim wording unless sourced: 独立负责全流程, 主导,
            核心成员, 精通, 熟练, 确保100%, 降低咨询量, 提升满意度,
            形成知识库, 技术团队, 产品与设计团队, 对话记录, 准确率.
          - Do not upgrade responsibility. "Participated in / 参与" stays
            participated; do not rewrite it as owned, led, orchestrated,
            or drove unless the source explicitly says so.
          - If a detail would make the resume stronger but is missing,
            use a visible placeholder such as [待补充] / [confirm] or mark
            it as a gap. Never fill it from common sense.
          - Each bullet must lead with a verb and contain ONE measurable
            outcome where the resume already has a number.
          - Skills must come from the user's source text. Do not invent
            software names or research methods.
          - Cut sections that are clearly off-topic for this JD.
          - Match the user's language. If LANGUAGE is zh or the request is
            mainly Chinese, write Simplified Chinese. If clarification is
            empty, use LANGUAGE from preferences instead of defaulting to
            English:
            {{ outputs.get('preferences', '') | truncate(400) }}

          Output a markdown resume with sections: Summary | Experience |
          Skills | Education. Add a "## Why I Tailored It This Way"
          section at the end (max 5 bullets) calling out what you
          reordered or rephrased and why.

          Language contract:
          - Match the user's language. If LANGUAGE is zh or the request is
            mainly Chinese, write Simplified Chinese.
          - If no external company fact is verified, say the letter is based
            on the JD summary and do not invent company facts.
          - Keep "participated in an AI customer-service pilot" as
            participation unless the source says the candidate owned it.
          - Do not add unprovided outcomes such as reduced tickets,
            customer interviews, NPS, A/B tests, FAQ impact, 100%
            delivery, AI accuracy evaluation, dialogue-log review, or tool names.
          - Do not call missing user-research preparation a fake or pretend
            research story. Frame it as learning a real method and honestly
            stating the gap.
          {{ outputs.get('preferences', '') | truncate(400) }}

          Output a single fenced ```text``` block — exactly 3 paragraphs,
          opening with a concrete sourced fact about the company or, if none
          is verified, a concrete JD requirement. End with one specific ask

          For TAILOR_NEW, do not use the raw tailor_resume or cover_letter
          draft text as source material because drafts may contain optimistic
          wording. Regenerate the final user-facing resume and letter from the
          Strict source fact ledger below.

          Available non-TAILOR_NEW step outputs (some may be empty if skipped):
          - interview_qs:
            {{ outputs.get('interview_qs', '') | truncate(3000) }}
          - study_brief:

          - compare_matrix:
            {{ outputs.get('compare_matrix', '') | truncate(2500) }}
          - ledger_summary:
            {{ outputs.get('ledger_summary', '') | truncate(2500) }}

          Company brief (if generated):
          {{ outputs.get('enrich_company', '') | truncate(800) }}

          Strict source fact ledger:
          {{ outputs.get('source_fact_ledger', '') | truncate(2500) }}

          Mode-specific structure:
          - TAILOR_NEW → "# 📄 Application Pack — <Company / Role>" header,
            then "## Tailored Resume" + "## Cover Letter" +
            "## JD Requirement / My Evidence / Gap Table" +
            "## Company Brief" + "## 48-Hour Interview Prep" +
            "## Suggested Next Steps".
          - INTERVIEW_PREP → "# 🎯 Interview Prep — <Company>" header, then
            "## Predicted Questions" + "## 48-Hour Study Plan" +
            "## Company Brief".
          - COMPARE_ROLES → "# ⚖️ Role Comparison" header, then
            "## Matrix" + "## My Take".
          - STATUS_DIGEST → "# 📋 Application Status Digest" header, then
            "## Ranked Next Actions" + "## Draft Nudges".

          Output language:
          - Match the user's language. If LANGUAGE is zh or the request is
            mainly Chinese, write Simplified Chinese, including headings.
          - If clarification did not run, use LANGUAGE from preferences.
          - Do not default Chinese user requests to English.
          {{ outputs.get('preferences', '') | truncate(400) }}

          For TAILOR_NEW, if tailored resume or cover letter outputs are
          empty or contain unsupported claims, write the final answer directly
          from the Strict source fact ledger and pasted request. Do not copy
          intermediate resume or cover-letter drafts verbatim; treat them only
          as rough drafts after source audit. Preserve truth: only use
          candidate facts present in the request, mark missing facts as gaps,
          and include a "Do not invent / 不编造" note. The JD/evidence/gap
          table must have rows for data analysis, user research or feedback,
          cross-functional launch coordination, release/user docs, sales or
          support alignment, and AI-tool exposure when those requirements are
          visible in the request. The 48-hour interview prep section should be
          useful even when no external company research was verified.
          For Chinese TAILOR_NEW outputs, use this conservative structure:
          "## 一、简历改写要点", "## 二、可直接粘贴的中文简历段落",
          "## 三、求职信", "## 四、JD 要求-我的证据-缺口表",
          "## 五、面试前 48 小时准备", "## 六、事实边界 / 不编造说明",
          and "## 七、下一步".
          In the resume paragraph, use conservative wording such as
          "负责过 3 个企业客户的上线培训", "用 SQL 做过留存报表",
          "把新手引导完成率从 52% 提升到 68%", "写过 20 多篇帮助文档",
          and "参与 AI 客服试点，但不是负责人" when those facts are present.
          Do not turn these into broader claims.
          Across all TAILOR_NEW sections, do not add unprovided tools,
          methods, outcomes, company facts, or software names. Do not upgrade
          participation to ownership. Use placeholders like [待补充] and
          explicit "缺口 / gap" labels for missing but useful details.
          Avoid overclaim wording unless sourced: 独立负责全流程, 主导,
          核心成员, 精通, 熟练, 确保100%, 降低咨询量, 提升满意度,
          形成知识库, 技术团队, 产品与设计团队, 对话记录, 准确率,
          independently owned, end-to-end owner, led, drove, core member,
          expert, guaranteed, knowledge base, FAQ, dialogue records, and
          accuracy evaluation.
          Before returning, audit every concrete claim against the Strict
          source fact ledger. If a claim is not in PROVIDED_CANDIDATE_FACTS,
          PROVIDED_JD_REQUIREMENTS, or PROVIDED_METRICS, remove it or mark it
          as [待补充]. Do not present FORBIDDEN_INFERENCES as facts. For Chinese
          TAILOR_NEW outputs, include a short section named
          "## 事实边界 / 不编造说明" stating that only user-provided facts were
          used and missing details are marked as gaps or placeholders.
          Keep the full output concise enough to complete in one turn. Do not
          include self-referential truncation notes such as "output truncated"
          or "系统生成". The 48-hour prep must include Day -2 and Day -1 with
          complete bullets.

          If the user wants to keep this somewhere (Notion / Google Doc
          / personal knowledge base), they can copy the markdown
          directly from this output — this is read-only and
          does not push to any external surface.

          End with a single line:
          PACK_MODE: {{ outputs.mode }}
    - id: deliver_jobpack_audit
      kind: llm_chat
      depends_on: [deliver_jobpack, source_fact_ledger, mode, preferences]
      with:
        system: "You are the final quality gate for a job-search deliverable. Return only the cleaned final answer that the user should read. Do not explain the audit. Do not mention workflow, meta-skill, tool names, connector failures, workspace paths, or runtime details."
        task: |
          Rewrite the draft below into the final user-facing application pack.
          Preserve useful content, but enforce the source fact ledger strictly.

          Mode label:

          Draft deliverable:
          {{ outputs.get('deliver_jobpack', '') | truncate(9000) }}

          Hard requirements:
          - Return markdown only. Never return JSON, a {"text": ...} wrapper,
            artifact metadata, file paths, download links, or attachment notes.
          - Remove leading process commentary such as "perfect for the
            meta-skill pipeline", "running it now", "I will run", "workflow",
            or any similar explanation of how the answer was produced.
          - Preserve the user's language. If the request is English, write
            English-only prose and English headings. If the request is Chinese,
            write Simplified Chinese and keep the Chinese structure.
          - For TAILOR_NEW, include resume rewrite points, paste-ready resume
            content, a cover letter or outreach email, JD requirement /
            evidence / gap table, 48-hour interview prep, and a no-fabrication
            note.
          - Audit every concrete claim against the strict source fact ledger.
            Remove or mark as [to fill] / [待补充] any company fact, tool,
            ownership claim, metric, method, or outcome not present in the
            user's request.
          - Do not upgrade participation into ownership. Keep "participated in
            an AI customer-service pilot, not the owner" when that is the
            available fact.
          - Remove internal sentinels such as PACK_MODE.

# meta-job-search-pipeline

Self-improver persona meta-skill. Handles 4 modes via an `llm_classify`
router — `TAILOR_NEW` (the default, pastes-JD-gets-application-pack
flow), `INTERVIEW_PREP`, `COMPARE_ROLES`, and `STATUS_DIGEST`. Each
mode unlocks only its relevant steps via `when:` conditions on the
classifier output, so a single composition handles all four without
forking the DAG into separate skills.

## Composition philosophy — multi-skill bundled orchestration

This meta-skill uses **only OpenSquilla-bundled atomic skills** plus the
five built-in step kinds — no external dependencies. The point of a
meta-skill is to *orchestrate* multiple skills, so this DAG calls into
**7 distinct bundled atomic skills**, each at the right point in the
pipeline:

| Skill | Step(s) | Role in the DAG |
|---|---|---|
| `multi-search-engine` | `web_research` | Web research per target company |
| `deep-research` | `deep_research` | Extra-context round for `INTERVIEW_PREP` only |
| `memory` | `recall_company`, `store_pack` | Cross-session memory of past company research and prior application packs — recalled before web research, stored after deliverable |
| `pptx` | `interview_deck` | Generate an interview-prep slide deck when `INTERVIEW_PREP` and the user mentions "deck" / "slides" / "幻灯" |
| `xlsx` | `tracker_xlsx` | Export the application ledger as a spreadsheet when `STATUS_DIGEST` |
| `docx` | `export_docx` | Optional final-deliverable export when the user picks `EXPORT_DOCX: YES` |

Step kinds used: `llm_chat`, `llm_classify`, `user_input`, `skill_exec`,
`agent`.

## What got dropped from the original 17-step design

The original draft had two ClawHub-shaped `skill_exec` steps that
turned out to be unnecessary:

- A `skill_exec: lead-enrichment` step that produced a structured
  company brief. The current `enrich_company` step (an `llm_chat`
  reading `outputs.web_research`) covers exactly the same contract
  with no external dependency. The original was the substitute path;
  it's now the primary path.
- A `skill_exec: notion-api-skill` step that POSTed the application
  pack to Notion. The deliverable is the markdown emitted by
  `deliver_jobpack`; the user copies it wherever they want.
  Convenience does not justify the dependency.

## Honest limitations

- **No application-ledger persistence.** `STATUS_DIGEST` mode is
  paste-driven: the user pastes their current ledger every turn. Once
  the proposed `state:` primitive ships, the ledger can persist across
  turns automatically.
- **No auto-apply.** The skill produces text for the user to send;
  there is no LinkedIn / job-board posting integration. This is a
  deliberate read-only design.
- **`COMPARE_ROLES` is text-based.** Without a `foreach` primitive,
  the matrix is one llm_chat call with multiple roles in the same
  prompt; per-role isolation would need `foreach`.
- **Interview prep depth.** `INTERVIEW_PREP` mode runs one
  `deep-research` round; a multi-round interview-loop would benefit
  from cross-turn state.
