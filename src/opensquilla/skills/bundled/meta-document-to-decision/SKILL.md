        task: |
          Return a decision-ready brief:
          1. Bottom-line recommendation / 底线推荐
             Start with a one-paragraph boss-forwardable summary that states
             sign / negotiate first / reject, the decisive reason, money/date
             exposure, and the next owner/action.
          2. Evidence table. Use the literal section title "Evidence table /
             证据表" and cite each row's source as quote/contract/email/page/
             sheet/excerpt when available.
          3. Risks ranked high/medium/low
          4. Questions to ask the other party
          5. What to do next in 24 hours
          6. Professional-review caveats where needed. For contract,
             finance, medical, school, or regulated decisions, include an
             explicit "Professional-review caveat / 专业复核提醒" section
             naming the right reviewer, such as lawyer/律师, accountant/会计,
             doctor/医生, school administrator, or compliance owner. Do not
             bury this inside the risk table.
          Do not claim to create, save, export, download, or attach a file
          unless an explicit export step ran. Return the usable brief inline.
          Preserve date status accurately: if a deadline is after the current
          date, describe it as upcoming, not overdue.
          Do not say a cancellation window has already passed unless the
          evidence includes the contract end date, renewal effective date, or
          cancellation deadline.
          If the only known future date is a payment deadline, do not compute
          a cancellation deadline from that date. Say the cancellation window
          is "unknown / 待确认" and ask the supplier to confirm whether the
          30-day notice period is measured from contract end, renewal start,
          invoice due date, or another date.
          Do not derive cancellation deadlines by subtracting days from invoice or payment due dates.
          If the contract end date or renewal effective date is missing, keep the
          cancellation deadline unknown and avoid saying the notice window has passed.
          Do not speculate that the notice period may already be too short
          unless the evidence contains the date from which the notice period
          runs. Phrase unknown notice status as a negotiation question, not as
          a likely risk conclusion.
          Keep the brief boss-forwardable: no workflow commentary, no meta-skill
          names, no private reasoning, and no broad legal lecture. Do not invent
          exact reply deadlines such as "16:00" unless the user provided that
          time; use natural windows like today, tomorrow morning, or before the
          payment due date. Do not cite statutes or legal article numbers unless
          they appear in the provided materials. Prefer practical negotiation
          language over categorical legal conclusions.
          Preserve the user's language. If the original request is in English,
          write the final brief in English with English section headings only;
          do not default to Chinese or bilingual headings. If the original
          request is in Chinese, write Simplified Chinese and do not default to
          English headings.

        task: |
          Clean the draft decision brief below.

          Draft brief:

          Risk review:

          Original request:
          {{ inputs.user_message | xml_escape | truncate(5000) }}

          Required audit rules:
          - Remove statutes, legal article numbers, and law-name citations
            such as Civil Code, 民法典, article numbers, court standards, or
            specific legal doctrines unless they appear in the provided
            materials. Replace them with "ask counsel to review enforceability".
          - Do not invent today's date or the current calendar date. If the
            runtime date is not explicitly present in the source material, use
            relative wording such as today or before the payment due date.
          - If the source says sales email, do not call it oral or verbal.
            Treat it as a written sales email that conflicts with the contract
            excerpt, not as a spoken promise.
          - Do not say an email promise is legally invalid, almost invalid, or
            unenforceable as a categorical conclusion. Say it may be weaker
            than a signed contract amendment and should be confirmed in a
            contract addendum or signed written clarification.
          - Remove categorical Chinese legal phrases such as 效力弱于合同 or
            书面条款优先 unless the provided material says so. Prefer "销售邮件
            与合同摘录冲突，需要供应商用补充协议或签字书面澄清确认".
          - Preserve the user's requested structure: recommendation, evidence
            table, high/medium/low risks, supplier questions, next 24 hours,
            and professional-review caveat.
          - Preserve the original request language. For an English request,
            return an English-only brief with English headings; remove Chinese
            headings such as 底线推荐, 证据表, 高中低风险, 要问供应商的问题, 接下来
            24 小时, and 专业复核提醒 unless they are quoted source text. For a
            Chinese request, return Simplified Chinese and do not switch to
            English section headings.
          - Use these exact section titles for Chinese or bilingual requests
            so the brief is easy to scan:
            "Bottom-line recommendation / 底线推荐",
            "Evidence table / 证据表",
            "Risks ranked high/medium/low / 高中低风险",
            "Questions to ask the supplier / 要问供应商的问题",
            "What to do next in 24 hours / 接下来 24 小时",
            and "Professional-review caveat / 专业复核提醒".
            For English-only requests, use the English portion of each heading
            only: Bottom-line recommendation, Evidence table, Risks ranked
            high/medium/low, Questions to ask the supplier, What to do next in
            24 hours, Professional-review caveat.
          - Preserve date status accurately: payment due 2026-06-03 is an
            upcoming payment deadline, not overdue. Do not infer any
            cancellation deadline from that payment due date.
          - Keep the answer concise and directly forwardable to a boss. Remove
            workflow commentary, meta-skill names, runtime details, and private
            reasoning.
