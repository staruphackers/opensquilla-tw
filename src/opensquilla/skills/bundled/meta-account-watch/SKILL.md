It is for sales/BD/competitive-intel briefs: current signals across pricing, product, leadership, hiring, partnerships, funding, and news; optional baseline diff; and follow-up recommendations. Do not use it for a generic daily plan, generic company research, product comparison without named accounts, or pasted old account-watch examples."

          - Do not convert PASTED_BASELINE facts into current signals. Baseline
            facts can be mentioned only as comparison context.
          - Preserve account names and requested dimensions from watch_context
            even when web research is sparse.

          Sort by strength desc, then account.

          Assemble the final watch brief.

          Account-watch context:

          Structure depends on depth:

          - EXEC_BRIEF → only the 5-bullet exec summary, then verdict
            line, then top 3 actions. Nothing else.
          - SINGLE_DEEP → full structure below.
          - MULTI_QUICK → full structure below, but trim signal table
            to top 10 rows.
          - DIFF_VS_BASELINE → lead with the baseline_diff section,
            then signals, then actions.

          Full structure:

          # <Verdict emoji> <Verdict label> — Account Watch <date range>

          Verdict emoji: 🟢 NO_NEW_SIGNAL, 🟡 LOW_SIGNAL, 🟠 MEDIUM_SIGNAL,
          🔴 HIGH_SIGNAL, ⛔ URGENT.

          ## TL;DR
          A 2-sentence summary grounded in the top signals.

          ## Signals
          {{ outputs.extract_signals | truncate(3000) }}

          ## vs Baseline
          {{ outputs.get('baseline_diff', '') | truncate(2000) }}
          (or "No baseline provided." if empty)

          ## Recommended Actions
          {{ outputs.recommend_actions | truncate(1500) }}

          Language: per preferences (default en).

          If the user wants to keep this brief somewhere (Notion / Google
          Doc / personal intel database), they can copy the markdown
          directly from this output — this is read-only and
          does not push to any external surface.

        task: |
          Rewrite the draft below into a clean account-watch brief for the user.

          Account-watch context:
          {{ outputs.get('watch_context', '') | truncate(2500) }}

          Draft brief:
          {{ outputs.get('deliver_watch_brief', '') | truncate(8000) }}

          Preferences:
          {{ outputs.get('preferences', '') | truncate(800) }}

          Required audit rules:
          - Remove runtime commentary, tool/debug narration, path references,
            connector wording, search-failure chatter, and any statement that
            internal steps ran or failed.
          - Remove artifact or attachment claims. Do not claim that a file was generated,
            downloaded, attached, saved, or can be fetched unless the user
            explicitly requested export and an export step is present.
          - If a signal has no source hint, no clear research evidence, or came
            only from the user's baseline, mark it as "未核验 / source limit"
            instead of presenting it as current fact.
          - When all current rows are "未见已核验新信号" or source-limited,
            lead with "未见已核验新增" rather than "确认无变化" or "无新信号".
            Source-limited evidence is not proof that nothing changed.
          - Do not say baseline judgments remain confirmed, still valid, or
            still hold unless there is current verified evidence supporting
            that exact judgment. Say "基线暂未被已核验证据推翻" instead.
          - Do not say public channels had no evidence, no public evidence was
            found, or no verified public updates unless the research output
            contains explicit checked-source coverage. Prefer "本轮可用证据未
            支撑新增判断".
          - For source-limited table rows, do not use words such as
            稳定、无变化、维持、沿用、继续主打、无扰动, or English equivalents
            like stable / unchanged / keep as-is. Use cautious implications
            such as "暂不作为优先跟进依据", "需要补充来源后再调整判断", or
            "可先保持观察，不把它当作已确认变化".
          - Do not name specific sources in the source-limit section unless
            extracted signals cite those exact sources with enough context to
            connect the source to the signal. If sources are not explicitly
            tied to rows, say "本轮可用材料未提供足够来源细节" instead of
            listing media, official sites, apps, or channels.
          - Preserve the user's requested structure: first say whether there are
            new signals, then account x dimension table, changes vs baseline,
            signal strength, high/medium/low priority, and who to follow up
            with today.
          - Do not invent leadership, funding, pricing, hiring, partnership,
            complaint, revenue, traffic, or ranking numbers. Use UNKNOWN or
            "未核验" when evidence is missing.
          - For Chinese requests, write concise Simplified Chinese suitable for
            a sales group. Avoid English headings unless the user asked.

          Output structure:
          ## 先说结论
          ## 账户 x 维度表
          ## 和上次基线相比
          ## 信号强度与优先级
          ## 今天该跟进谁
          ## 来源限制 / 未核验点

# meta-account-watch

Connector / competitive-intel meta-skill. Monitors one to a handful of
target accounts across pricing, product, leadership, hiring, and news
dimensions; extracts grounded signals; classifies a verdict; produces
a brief with concrete actions. Always read-only — never sends emails,
posts, or modifies tracker data.

## Composition philosophy — multi-skill bundled orchestration

This meta-skill uses **only OpenSquilla-bundled atomic skills** plus
the five built-in step kinds — no external dependencies. The DAG calls
into **5 distinct bundled atomic skills**:

| Skill | Step(s) | Role in the DAG |
|---|---|---|
| `multi-search-engine` | `web_research` | Primary research source across all accounts |
| `deep-research` | `deep_dive` | Extra rounds for `SINGLE_DEEP` mode only |
| `memory` | `recall_baseline`, `store_brief` | Cross-session continuity. `recall_baseline` pulls the last brief from durable memory automatically so `baseline_diff` works even when the user didn't paste a baseline; `store_brief` writes this run for next time. **This pair effectively delivers what the proposed `state:` primitive would give us.** |
| `xlsx` | `signals_xlsx` | When the user explicitly asks for a spreadsheet / `xlsx` / download / export, export the signal table + baseline diff as a workbook |
| `docx` | `export_docx` | Optional final DOCX export |

Step kinds used: `llm_chat`, `llm_classify`, `user_input`, `skill_exec`,
`agent`.

Direct URL fetching of competitor pages is intentionally out of scope
for this skill — the search results from `web_research` are normally
enough, and adding URL-scrape would require a compliance-aware fetcher
not currently bundled. If the user wants page-level detail, they can
paste the page content into the next turn.

Persistence to Notion / external knowledge bases is also out of scope:
the deliverable is the markdown emitted by `deliver_watch_brief`; the
user copies it wherever they want.

## Mode design

Four depth labels via `llm_classify: depth`:

- `SINGLE_DEEP` — one account, multi-round deep-research, full
  signal table, full actions. Best for "tell me everything about
  $competitor's last quarter."
- `MULTI_QUICK` — 2-5 accounts, scan-level coverage, top-10 signal
  table. Best for "what did these 5 do this month?"
- `DIFF_VS_BASELINE` — baseline text was pasted, the run leads with
  the diff section. Best for "what's new since I last looked?"
- `EXEC_BRIEF` — 5-bullet executive summary + verdict + top 3
  actions, nothing else. Best for "give me something to forward to
  the CEO."

## Honest limitations (first-wave)

- **No `state:` primitive.** Baselines are pasted each turn; the
  proposed `state:` would persist last run's signals automatically.
- **No `foreach`.** When 5 accounts are watched, the LLM steps see
  all 5 in one prompt. With `foreach`, each account would get its own
  isolated step + audit trail per account.
- **No alerting.** The skill produces a brief on demand; it doesn't
  push notifications. A future combination with `cron` (bundled) +
  the proposed `event_trigger` primitive would give a "watch this
  every Monday" mode.
