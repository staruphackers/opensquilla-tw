description: "Use this meta-skill instead of answering directly when the current user asks for competitive-intel monitoring over a defined company, competitor, prospect, or partner set and time window. It is for sales/BD/strategy briefs: current signals across pricing, product, leadership, hiring, partnerships, funding, and news; optional baseline diff; and follow-up recommendations. Do not use it for a generic daily plan, generic company research, product comparison without named target companies, or pasted old competitive-intel examples."

            comprehensive multi-source dive.
          - MULTI_QUICK: 2-5 accounts, scan-level coverage per account.
          - DIFF_VS_BASELINE: baseline text was pasted; the value of
            this run is the diff, not the absolute snapshot.

            capture those statements under PASTED_BASELINE even if
            intel_clarify did not run.
          - Keep baseline facts separate from current signals. They are
            comparison material, not evidence that something happened now.
          - If account or dimension names are visible in the raw user request,
            do not ask for them again.

            include Chinese name, English name, product names, and common
            romanization when obvious (for example Kimi / Moonshot AI,
            MiniMax / 海螺AI / abab).
          - Include the user's time window and requested dimensions as short
            natural-language search terms.
          - Do not include internal context keys like ACCOUNTS, DIMENSIONS,
            ACCOUNT_DIMENSION_GRID, USER_MARKET_POSITION, or PASTED_BASELINE
            in either query.
          - Avoid long Boolean expressions. If there are many accounts or
            dimensions, choose the terms most likely to retrieve current
            company news, product/pricing pages, funding, hiring, and
            partnership announcements.

            source_hint "source limit / 未核验", and a practical implication.
          - If final search status is SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE, use
            "检索不可用 / source unavailable" in source_hint and make the
            implication ask for source repair or manual verification. Do not

          - If final search status is SEARCH_EMPTY, use
            "未返回可用结果 / source limit" in source_hint and keep the wording
            cautious.
          - Do not convert PASTED_BASELINE facts into current signals. Baseline
            facts can be mentioned only as comparison context.
          - Preserve account names and requested dimensions from intel_context
            even when web research is sparse.

          Sort by strength desc, then account.
          Drop signals where strength is LOW and the source hint is
          vague ("unconfirmed", "rumour") unless the row is one of the
          requested no-verified-new-signal placeholder rows.

            internal steps ran or failed.

            downloaded, attached, saved, or can be fetched unless the user
            explicitly requested export and an export step is present.
          - If a signal has no source hint, no clear research evidence, or came
            only from the user's baseline, mark it as "未核验 / source limit"
            instead of presenting it as current fact.

            lead with "未见已核验新增" rather than "确认无变化" or "无新信号".
            Source-limited evidence is not proof that nothing changed.
          - Do not say baseline judgments remain confirmed, still valid, or
            still hold unless there is current verified evidence supporting
            that exact judgment. Say "基线暂未被已核验证据推翻" instead.
          - Do not say public channels had no evidence, no public evidence was
            found, or no verified public updates unless the research output
            contains explicit checked-source coverage. Prefer "本轮可用证据未
            支撑新增判断".
          - For source-limited table rows, do not use words such as
            稳定、无变化、维持、沿用、继续主打、无扰动, or English equivalents
            like stable / unchanged / keep as-is. Use cautious implications
            such as "暂不作为优先跟进依据", "需要补充来源后再调整判断", or
            "可先保持观察，不把它当作已确认变化".
          - Do not name specific sources in the source-limit section unless
            extracted signals cite those exact sources with enough context to
            connect the source to the signal. If sources are not explicitly
            tied to rows, say "本轮可用材料未提供足够来源细节" instead of
            listing media, official sites, apps, or channels.
          - Preserve the user's requested structure: first say whether there are
            new signals, then account x dimension table, changes vs baseline,
            signal strength, high/medium/low priority, and who to follow up
            with today.
          - Do not invent leadership, funding, pricing, hiring, partnership,
            complaint, revenue, traffic, or ranking numbers. Use UNKNOWN or
            "未核验" when evidence is missing.
          - For Chinese requests, write concise Simplified Chinese suitable for
            a sales group. Avoid English headings unless the user asked.

# meta-competitive-intel

Connector / competitive-intel meta-skill. Monitors one to a handful of
target companies across pricing, product, leadership, hiring, and news
dimensions; extracts grounded signals; classifies a verdict; produces
a brief with concrete actions. Always read-only — never sends emails,
posts, or modifies tracker data.

## Composition philosophy — multi-skill bundled orchestration

This meta-skill uses **only OpenSquilla-bundled atomic skills** plus
the five built-in step kinds — no external dependencies. The DAG calls
into **5 distinct bundled atomic skills**:

| Skill | Step(s) | Role in the DAG |
|---|---|---|
| `multi-search-engine` | `web_research`, `web_research_target_1..3`, `web_research_retry` | Primary, target-level, and fallback research source, fed by LLM-generated short search queries rather than raw target grids |
| `deep-research` | `deep_dive` | Extra rounds for `SINGLE_DEEP` mode only |
| `memory` | `recall_baseline`, `store_brief` | Cross-session continuity. `recall_baseline` pulls the last brief from durable memory automatically so `baseline_diff` works even when the user didn't paste a baseline; `store_brief` writes this run for next time. **This pair effectively delivers what the proposed `state:` primitive would give us.** |
| `xlsx` | `signals_xlsx` | When the user explicitly asks for a spreadsheet / `xlsx` / download / export, export the signal table + baseline diff as a workbook |
| `docx` | `export_docx` | Optional final DOCX export |

Step kinds used: `llm_chat`, `llm_classify`, `user_input`, `skill_exec`,
`agent`.

Before search, `search_strategy` uses the LLM to translate structured intel
context into compact `SEARCH_QUERY` lines with target aliases and product
names. The flow then adds focused target-specific searches for the first
three monitored targets, so a broad competitive-intel request does not depend
on one generic multi-company result. This keeps generalized inputs such as
Chinese company names, baseline-diff requests, and "all dimensions" replies
from becoming brittle YAML-like search strings.

Direct URL fetching of competitor pages is intentionally out of scope
for this skill — the search results from `web_research` are normally
enough, and adding URL-scrape would require a compliance-aware fetcher
not currently bundled. If the user wants page-level detail, they can
paste the page content into the next turn.

Persistence to Notion / external knowledge bases is also out of scope:
the deliverable is the markdown emitted by `deliver_intel_brief`; the
user copies it wherever they want.

## Mode design

Four depth labels via `llm_classify: depth`:

- `SINGLE_DEEP` — one target, multi-round deep-research, full
  signal table, full actions. Best for "tell me everything about
  $competitor's last quarter."
- `MULTI_QUICK` — 2-5 accounts, scan-level coverage, top-10 signal
  table. Best for "what did these 5 do this month?"
- `DIFF_VS_BASELINE` — baseline text was pasted, the run leads with
  the diff section. Best for "what's new since I last looked?"
- `EXEC_BRIEF` — 5-bullet executive summary + verdict + top 3
  actions, nothing else. Best for "give me something to forward to
  the CEO."

## Honest limitations (first-wave)

- **No `state:` primitive.** Baselines are pasted each turn; the
  proposed `state:` would persist last run's signals automatically.
- **No `foreach`.** The first three targets get focused search lanes; beyond
  that, remaining targets share the broad query context. With `foreach`, each
  target would get its own isolated step + audit trail per target.
- **No alerting.** The skill produces a brief on demand; it doesn't
  push notifications. A future combination with `cron` (bundled) +
  the proposed `event_trigger` primitive would give a "monitor this
  every Monday" mode.
