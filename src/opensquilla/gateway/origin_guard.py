"""Same-origin guard and HTTP auth helpers shared by gateway HTTP routes.

A hostile web page can make a loopback victim's browser fire state-changing
requests at the gateway (classic cross-site request forgery): simple POSTs
execute server-side even when the browser withholds the response from the
page. The diagnostics-bundle route shipped the first same-origin check; this
module is the single shared implementation for every state-changing or
sensitive owner route.

Policy (matches the bundle-route precedent):

* Requests without an ``Origin`` header pass — curl, the CLI, and the desktop
  client's Node fetch are not browser-mediated and never send one.
* Same-origin requests pass — the gateway serves the Web UI itself, so its
  ``Origin`` always matches the request's own scheme/host/port.
* Origins explicitly listed in ``cors.allowed_origins`` pass — an operator who
  deliberately configured a separate frontend keeps a working deployment. The
  ``"*"`` wildcard never bypasses the guard; it would reopen the exact
  drive-by exposure this module exists to close.
* Everything else — including the opaque ``"null"`` origin and unparsable
  values — is rejected with 403 ``FORBIDDEN_ORIGIN``.
