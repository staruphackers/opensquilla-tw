"""Generalised path alias for sandbox / model-hallucinated workspace paths.

The LLM may emit absolute paths that "look like" a workspace but don't
match the gateway's configured ``workspace_root`` byte-for-byte. Three
typical sources observed in production:

* ``/workspace/...`` — the canonical cwd that ``execute_code`` sandboxes
  expose to the model. The LLM sees this in stdout and reuses it in
  subsequent ``read_file`` / ``write_file`` / ``publish_artifact`` calls.
* ``<default-home>/.opensquilla/workspace/...`` — the default workspace
  pattern. LLMs trained on OpenSquilla docs may emit this even when the
  gateway has overridden ``workspace_dir`` in config.toml.
* ``<other-home>/.opensquilla/workspace/...`` — same prior on alternate
  deployments.

Rather than maintain a growing list of known prefixes, we recognise
the **shape**: any absolute path with a segment literally named
``workspace`` is treated as workspace-rooted, and everything **after
the last such segment** becomes the workspace-relative tail. The tail
is then resolved against the real ``workspace_root``.

Examples (with ``workspace_root = <configured-workspace>``):

* ``<default-home>/.opensquilla/workspace/abstract.tex``
  → tail ``abstract.tex`` → ``<configured-workspace>/abstract.tex``
* ``<other-home>/.opensquilla/workspace/papers/intro.tex``
  → tail ``papers/intro.tex`` → ``<configured-workspace>/papers/intro.tex``
* ``/workspace/foo`` → ``<configured-workspace>/foo``
* ``<configured-workspace>/x.tex`` (the real path)
  → tail ``x.tex`` → identical resolved path (idempotent, harmless)
* ``/etc/passwd`` — no ``workspace`` segment, ``None`` returned, the
  caller's pre-existing sensitive-path / workspace-strict checks run
  unchanged.

The alias only fires when ``workspace_root`` is configured and the
input is absolute. Relative paths are left for the caller's existing
"join under workspace_root" logic.
